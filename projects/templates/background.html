  <p align="justify">Premier Alexander Romanov was installed by Allied leaders to the position of Soviet premier and was to keep the USSR in peaceful relations with the West. Suddenly, Allied spies cut contacts with their headquarters, and were seen operating with KGB agents. The Soviets invaded the Allied nations without warning, quickly reaching the United States of America. American president Michael Dugan ordered a nuclear strike on the Soviet Union, but silo operator Jerry Boyd was mind-controlled by Yuri to sabotage the silo, leading to the nuclear missiles detonating on closed silo doors.</p>

  <h3>盟軍劇情</h3>
  <p align="justify">
    盟軍劇情由一支以特務譚雅帶領的特種部隊被送到紐約開始，對抗蘇聯入侵。指揮官（玩家）在譚雅的幫助下，順利地消滅在紐約的蘇聯軍隊。譚雅和指揮官然後派遣到科罗拉多斯普林斯解放那裡的美國空軍學院和空軍基地。同時，蘇聯在華盛頓特區部署了一個名為「心靈信標」的設備。心靈信標能控制整個城市人口的心靈，蘇聯設法控制美國總統和華盛頓的主要官員，讓美國向蘇聯投降。然而，一次由指揮官指揮的反擊破壞了心靈信標。美國政府迅速遷移到加拿大，以逃脫蘇聯心靈控制的威脅。遷移政府到加拿大後，盟軍情報發現蘇聯在芝加哥部署了另一個心靈控制設備，「心靈控制增幅器」，它是一個有能力控制整個北美洲的大型設備。盟軍從加拿大動員部隊，橫跨密西根湖，展開渡湖的兩棲攻擊，闖入被蘇聯佔領的芝加哥，解放城市和毀壞心靈控制增幅器。為了報復，蘇聯軍隊的最高司令維拉迪摩將軍，宣稱芝加哥對他已經沒有用，並且對芝加哥發動一次核攻擊，完全摧毀芝加哥。芝加哥的核攻擊驚動了歐洲，法國、德國和英國同意幫助美國，但要求美國軍隊先破壞位於波蘭的兩座蘇聯核彈發射井。美國總統麥可·杜根同意，送由譚雅帶領的一隊特種部隊，進入波蘭與德國的邊界。特種部隊成功摧毀了發射井，并且歐洲加入對抗蘇聯的戰爭。得到額外的士兵和軍備支持，美軍能展開對被蘇聯佔領的華盛頓特區的一次兩棲攻擊和奪回城市。在奪回華盛頓以後，盟軍情報顯露蘇聯計劃奪取夏威夷海島，并且指揮官派遣到珍珠港保衛海島。夏威夷的危機解除，但是美國仍然在一個飄搖的位置。蘇聯在心靈信標幫助下，控制密西西比河南部的聖路易斯，嚴重妨礙美國發動地面作戰的能力。因此盟軍對城市展開攻擊，毀壞心靈信標和解放城市。盟軍也得知蘇聯在墨西哥图卢姆的研究基地企圖複製光棱技術。因此派遣一支海豹部隊摧毀該研究基地設施，蘇聯的企圖失敗。卡維利將軍在一次對指揮官的簡報中，說他們要前往德國。他說盟軍領導會派出部隊到德國黑森林保護愛因斯坦實驗室。愛因斯坦的實驗室有超時空傳送儀的原型，一個能夠運輸部隊到世界上任何地方的設備。在卡維利將軍離開辦公室的時候，瘋狂伊文在等待卡維利並引爆炸彈，暗殺了卡維利將軍。指揮官派遣到黑森林並對付蘇聯軍隊。愛因斯坦實驗室和超時空傳送儀安然無恙，愛因斯坦繼續他的工作。在此以後，愛因斯坦親自感謝指揮官，說他發現了最佳部署超時空傳送儀的地方。它是在一個在佛羅里達礁島群的小島，而且離古巴只有幾公里。盟軍派軍隊到小島駐軍并且在那裡建造基地和超時空傳送儀，然後進入古巴摧毀三座蘇聯核彈發射井。指挥官继任盟军总司令，盟軍使用超時空傳送儀的遠距傳物能力把一隊盟軍突擊隊帶到莫斯科。盟軍其後在克里姆林宮附近，發動突襲摧毀防禦，然後譚雅立刻俘虜了洛馬諾夫主席。蘇聯向盟軍投降。但是作為挑起這場戰爭的幕後黑手的尤里卻不知所蹤……而最後，譚雅會以身穿著禮服邀請指揮官和自己共同參加總統在白宮設下的晚宴...... 
  
  </p>

  <p align="justify">The Allied storyline begins with a strike team led by the Commander and Special Agent Tanya into the streets of New York City to defend Fort Bradley and repel the Soviet invasion force there. The player, with help from Tanya, successfully repels the Soviet invasion of New York City.

  Tanya and the Commander are then sent to liberate the US Air Force Academy and the air base in Colorado Springs. After recapturing the academy and the air base and halting the Soviets' advance into the midwest, it is discovered that a Soviet psychic device known as the Psychic Beacon, a device that can mind-control the population of entire cities, has been deployed in Washington, D.C.

  The Psychic Beacon manages to take control of President Dugan, general Ben Carville, and several other key Allied leaders in the city, who promptly surrender the United States to the Soviets. However, a quick and valiant counter-strike by the Commander destroys the Psychic Beacon and frees the Allied leaders and military officials from the Soviets' mind control, allowing them to be rescued and evacuated from the city.

  Unfortunately for the Allies, Washington, D.C. still remains in Soviet hands. The American government and military are forced to relocate to Canada to escape from the Soviets and their mind control technology for the time being. Once the US military and its leaders take refuge in Canada, Allied intelligence discovers that the Soviets have deployed another psychic device, known as the Psychic Amplifier, in the city of Chicago.

  Unlike the Psychic Beacon of Washington, the Psychic Amplifier has the power “to do to the country what the Psychic Beacon did to Washington”. The Allies promptly launch an amphibious offensive from across Lake Michigan into Soviet-occupied Chicago, freeing the city and destroying the Psychic Amplifier in a surprise attack against the Soviets.

  But in retaliation, the Soviet General Vladimir, the chief commander of the invading Soviet forces, declares that he no longer has any use for the city of Chicago and detonates a nuclear device, completely destroying the city.

  Alarmed by the nuclear attack on Chicago, the European Allied leaders of France, Germany and Great Britain are willing to lend help to the USA, but only if the American Commander and Special Agent Tanya can send in a strike team to disable the Soviet medium-range nuclear missile silos located along the Polish-German border. In a daring covert operation, Allied spies infiltrate the Soviet Battle Lab and destroy the two Nuclear Missile silos in Soviet-occupied Poland.

  Free from the fear of Soviet nuclear counterattack, the European Allies join with the Americans in the war against the Soviets. With additional men and equipment from the European Allies, the US launches an new assault on Soviet-occupied Washington, D.C., reinforcing Allied forces at the Pentagon and, with the assistance of German professor Albert Einstein's Weaponized Prism technology, succeed in liberating the capital from the Soviets.

  With Washington back under American control, Allied leaders are now able to launch a new battle plan to drive the Soviets out of America. Allied intelligence reveals that a large Soviet naval fleet led by General Vladimir is en route to invade the Hawaiian islands. The Commander is sent to the Allied naval base of Pearl Harbor to defend the islands and succeeds in destroying the invading Soviet naval force and reclaiming Nihau, Hawaii from the Soviets. However, the Allies are still in a precarious position in the war against the Soviets back in the continental United States.

  The Soviets, using their psychic technology once again, have deployed another Psychic Beacon and taken control of St. Louis, Missouri, the heart of Allied ground control operations in the United States. Special Agent Tanya and the Commander lead a strike team to destroy the beacon and liberate the city, narrowly escaping the effects of the Psychic Beacon themselves.

  After St. Louis is freed, the Allies learn of a Soviet project to replicate Albert Einstein's Weaponized Prism technology at a research base in Tulum, Mexico. A team of Navy SEALs is para-dropped into the area to destroy the research facility and whatever attempts the Soviets have made to replicate the Allies' Weaponized Prism technology. The mission is successful and the Allies' Weaponized Prism technology is not compromised.

  In a briefing to the Commander, General Carville, says that they are being shipped off to Germany. Carville himself is headed to Berlin to plan the Allied invasion into Russia while he sends the Commander to the Black Forest to join up with Allied forces to protect Albert Einstein’s laboratory and his prototype Chronosphere, a device with the ability to move troops to any location in the world, against a large Soviet invasion force.

  However, as General Carville is about to leave his office at the end of the briefing, a Crazy Ivan, a Soviet unit which utilizes explosives, ambushes the Allied General at the door and detonates his explosives, killing Carville. Despite the tremendous loss of a great leader to the Allies, the Commander is successful in repelling the Soviet invasion from across the border into the Black Forest, ultimately saving Einstein's laboratory and his Chronosphere.

  Einstein personally thanks the Commander for saving his home and tells the Commander that he has been researching for many days and nights to find the best place to deploy his Chronosphere. Einstein determines that perfect place to deploy his Chronosphere is "on a tiny island in the Florida Keys, just a few short kilometers from Soviet Cuba”.

  Unfortunately, this distance is within range of three Soviet nuclear missile silos in Cuba. The Allies send a force to the island to establish a base and construct the Chronosphere there, and then launch an attack to destroy the Soviet nuclear strike capabilities in Cuba.

  With the Chronosphere successfully deployed in the Florida Keys, the Allies prepare for one final assault on the city of Moscow to capture the Kremlin and end the war for good. Using the Chronosphere, the Allied forces led by the Commander teleport begin their assault on Moscow.

  In perhaps the greatest and toughest battle of the entire war, the Allies manage to eliminate Romanov's Elite Black Guard defending the Kremlin and a strike team lead by Tanya is teleported in to secure the Kremlin and capture Premier Alexander Romanov. The war ends with the Soviets suffering a humiliating surrender and a second defeat at the hands of the Allies. </p>

  <h3>蘇軍劇情</h3>
  <p align="justify">
    苏联在华盛顿哥伦比亚特区上空大量空投伞兵，部署了基地，利用强大的地面力量，迅速摧毁了五角大楼。初期的胜利加大了苏联的野心，苏军希望摧毁美军位于佛罗里达的海军基地，以为全线登陆做准备。在中途弗拉基米尔声称“用一只橡皮鸭就可以消灭美国海军”，但是自行前行遇到美国海军驱逐舰拦截时却先逃走了。随后一批苏联潜艇前来支援，帮助玩家成功地摧毁了美海军基地。弗拉基米尔先行回国，罗曼诺夫听到捷报后很高兴，并且给弗拉基米尔颁发了斯大林奖章。尤里知道后很生气，对弗拉基米尔心生恨意，但暂时又无可奈何。尤里当时正在研发“心灵信标”，但是他需要盟军科技。苏联红军开进纽约，工程师占领了纽约的作战实验室，心灵信标在纽约被建起，随后当地所有美军全部宣誓加入苏军。美军节节败退，韩国表示願意提供支援，并派兵入侵苏联海参崴。尤里和罗曼诺夫正在讨论派遣哪位指挥官。罗曼诺夫主张派遣弗拉基米尔去，尤里便打开电视，看见弗拉基米尔正在与几个女人泡温泉。玩家被派往前线，同时一种叫“恐怖机器人”的新武器也开始投入实战，这种轻型机器人可以将坦克变成碎片，但是装甲很薄。因为新武器的采用，韩国军队很快被赶回大海。美军在重压之下，向欧洲盟友求援。欧洲盟友承诺出兵，但是这也导致了这些盟友内部防御力量的亏空。苏军这时乘虚而入，用一支小分队侵入巴黎，并且用磁暴步兵磁化了埃菲尔铁塔。巴黎的盟军很快被击溃。苏军节节挺进，但尤里与弗拉基米尔的关系却不断恶化。在苏军全歼韩国海军并且占领夏威夷后，两人彻底闹翻，罗曼诺夫因为“健康问题”又一直不在，尤里成为苏军最高司令，实际上担当苏联部长会议主席（总理）职务。盟军将要用超时空传送仪入侵苏联位于乌拉尔山的实验室，那里正在研发天启坦克。超时空传送仪由爱因斯坦建造，而爱因斯坦对尤里的心灵控制先天免疫。后来天启坦克被生产出来，用车载对空飞弹和双管主炮守住了实验室。尤里声称罗曼诺夫主席被“叛徒”弗拉基米尔将军杀害（实际是尤里所为并嫁祸弗拉基米尔），命令玩家追杀弗拉基米尔。弗拉基米尔逃到蘇佔美国华盛顿，但是被尤里的心灵控制所感应出。玩家率领苏军又一次开进华盛顿，白宫被苏军摧毁，苏军从废墟中找出了弗拉基米尔，但是还没等到弗拉基米尔解释时他便已经被心灵控制并被当场处决。尤里此时发现美国总统杜根已经退到了得克萨斯州圣安东尼奥的阿拉莫。周围由重兵把守，从警犬到海豹部队应有尽有。苏军试图空降部队俘获杜根，但没有成功。尤里想到即使把杜根抓住也不会屈服，不如直接把他心灵控制。于是，蘇聯改而派出「超能力部队」——尤里的复制人，最终成功控制了杜根。接着，尤里发现美军在中美洲的美属维尔京群岛測試天气控制仪，这个由爱因斯坦发明的仪器可以产生强大的闪电风暴。尤里批准玩家使用核弹，苏联工程师占领了那里的作战实验室，取得了天气控制仪的坐标。最终天气控制仪被摧毁，苏联统治全球只是时间问题了。尤里突然请玩家到莫斯科，表示要亲自接见。通讯官佐菲雅此时突然收到一卷录像带，是罗曼诺夫主席生前的一段訊息，罗曼诺夫表示尤里心灵控制了他，并且「杀害」了他。玩家率领苏军进攻莫斯科，叛国的尤里所藏匿的克里姆林宫最终变成废墟，尤里被埋于废墟之下，玩家继任苏军最高司令。索菲亚在整理尤里的档案时发现，尤里留下了一份「离别礼物」：盟军在阿拉斯加的希望之角有一部超时空传送仪，并且有重兵把守。苏军跨海作战，顺利登陆，摧毁了盟军最后一座的超时空传送仪。盟军战败，玩家成为新一任苏联部长会议主席（总理）甚至是“世界总理”，成为世界的统治者。苏军在伦敦、巴黎等全球各地进行盛大阅兵，欢庆「共产主义」的到来，玩家在巴黎凯旋门前香榭丽舍大街的阅兵式上现身。但是，有一个很大的后患，尤里运用复制中心，复制出了无数个自己……
    
  </p>

  <p align="justify">The Soviet storyline begins with the player being briefed by Premier Alexander Romanov about the upcoming Soviet invasion of the United States of America.

  Romanov tells the player that the first priority is the destruction of the headquarters of the American military, the Pentagon. The Commander carries out this order, leading an invasion into Washington, D.C. and destroying the Pentagon. Another Soviet invasion is launched into Florida to destroy the American fleet there, which was threatening the Soviet invasion of the East Coast.

  Even though the Commander is almost fully responsible for these victories, all the credit goes to the top Soviet commander, General Vladimir. Yuri recommends that the player captures New York City with a Psychic Beacon, a device that can mind-control the population of entire cities, while Vladimir is in Moscow celebrating so that Yuri and the "Comrade General" can also get some fame and glory.

  The player follows Yuri's advice, and launches an offensive into New York City. After capturing the Allied Battle Lab, or research facility, at the World Trade Center, the Psychic Beacon is deployed and the entire population of the city falls under Soviet control.

  To counter the ever increasing and successful Soviet threat, forces from the Republic of Korea launch an amphibious attack on Vladivostok, and the player must "defend the motherland" at all costs. The Commander ruthlessly defends the "motherland", crushing all invading Korean forces in a brutal counter-attack. Alarmed by the situation, leaders of Allied Forces agree to send troops to the Polish border to help the USA fight the Soviets.

  While the French Military has amassed near Poland, the Soviets send a special forces team to Paris, with special orders from Romanov and Yuri to "show the Allies the true meaning of Soviet irony" and to "leave nothing".

  Once in Paris, the Soviets fight to capture the area around the Eiffel Tower. The Soviets then use three Tesla Troopers, soldiers with the ability to destroy vehicles with electric charges, to energize the "Eiffel Tower" and effectively turn it into a massive Tesla Coil, a tower which uses massive electric bursts to destroy its targets. The energized "Eiffel Tower" quickly destroys all Allied forces in the city and devastates Paris.

  With this and other key victories in Europe, the nations of Europe are in a position of needing help itself rather than giving help to the USA. During this time, Yuri has been gaining more and more power by using his telepathic abilities to mind control Romanov. As a result, Romanov gives all military authority to Yuri, which greatly angers General Vladimir, who accuses Yuri of forcing Romanov to make that decision.

  Yuri discards these accusations and tells the player to establish a "Soviet presence" in the Hawaiian Islands. The Commander is sent to the islands and destroys the American Pacific Fleet and all Korean reinforcements, allowing the Soviets to easily take over the islands.

  Meanwhile, Romanov has become very ill and Yuri's intelligence has revealed that the Allies have constructed a Chronosphere, a device with the ability to transport troops anywhere in the world. The Allies intend to use the Chronosphere to launch an assault on a Soviet research facility in the Ural Mountains.

  Yuri tells the player that this research facility is vital to the Soviet war effort and that it must be defended at all costs. The player takes command of Soviet forces at the research facility and manages to repel several Allied attacks on the facility.

  While the Soviet research facility is saved, Yuri has murdered Romanov in his hospital bed, but framed General Vladimir for the crime. Yuri orders the commander to go to Washington D.C. to eliminate Vladimir, who Yuri declares to be a traitor and a "nonperson".

  The player defeats Vladimir's forces and captures Vladimir in the White House with the aid of Yuri's psychic technology. In another briefing with Yuri, the player is informed of Yuri's plan to mind control the U.S. president Michael Dugan and thus be able to indirectly influence the American government and military.

  A Soviet strike team of psychic commandos is then sent to San Antonio, Texas and covertly infiltrates the American base there around the Alamo and then put President Dugan under Soviet mind-control. The Soviets then discover that the Allies are developing a new super weapon in the U.S. Virgin Islands, known as a Weather Control Device, a device that can create thunderstorms with the power to devastate large areas.

  The Soviets launch an amphibious assault on the islands and successfully destroy the device before it gets a chance to be activated. Impressed by the tenacity of the “Comrade General”, Yuri asks the Commander to come to Moscow so he can thank the Commander in person. But Lieutenant Zofia tells the player about a video Romanov recorded before his death.

  In the video, Romanov, with much difficulty, says that Yuri is controlling his mind and orders the Commander to bring the traitor to justice. The Commander goes to Moscow, but with a large army and the intent of apprehending Yuri.

  Upon their arrival in Moscow, the player’s forces engage with forces loyal to Yuri. The player then launches a devastating attack on the Kremlin and Yuri is believed to be dead. After going through Yuri’s files, it is learned that the Allies have built a Chronosphere in Alaska, which they will use to attempt to launch a final assault into the Soviet Union.

  Soviet forces are sent across the Bering Strait and destroy the Chronosphere and all Allied forces in the area. With all resistance destroyed, the player is now free to rule the world. However, in the end cut scene, Yuri's mind has somehow survived and telepathically communicates to the commander saying, “It would have been good to see inside your brain, Comrade. I still may get the chance...” </p>

  <h3>背景</h3>
  <p align="justify">
    躲藏的尤里计划通过使用他的心灵控制器，一种有能力控制人颣心灵的大型设备，控制整个世界。

    剧情从一次白宫的简报会开始，尤里打断了简报会并且告诉美国总统麦可·杜根，他在全球建立了一个由心灵控制器组成的网络，并计划心灵控制整个行星。其中一个心灵控制器是在旧金山的恶魔岛上并且尤里在简报会的结尾启动了它。

    杜根总统立刻下令对心灵控制器展开空袭。但是所有AV-8B攻击机被击落，虽然其中一架撞入恶魔岛的核反应堆，造成设备缺电而不能启动。尽管如此，尤里启动了他的另外两个心灵控制器（分为埃及大金字塔附近和南极），地球上的大多人口迅速被尤里心灵控制了。
  </p>

  <p align="justify">Yuri, the powerful Soviet psychic and advisor, disappeared after the Allied victory over the Soviet Union.

  The American President Michael Dugan was called to an emergency meeting at the White House regarding Yuri's activities. Yuri disrupts the briefing, revealing to the stunned president that he had built a network of psychic dominators, which he intended to use to enslave the entire planet.

  As Yuri activates one of the Psychic Dominator devices on Alcatraz Island, President Dugan orders an airstrike. All the attacking aircraft were shot down, but one crashed on to the nuclear reactor that provided energy to the device, thus powering it down.

  Yuri activates the other two Psychic Dominators anyway, turning much of world's population into mind-controlled slaves. As his troops entered San Francisco to capture power plants in order to bring the Alcatraz Psychic Dominator online, Professor Einstein hatched a plan to travel back in time to the events of Third World War in order to stop Yuri and prevent the Psychic Dominator Disaster. </p>

  <h3>盟軍劇情</h3>
  <p align="justify">
    盟军的故事，从指挥官（玩家）被送到旧金山而开始，保护爱因斯坦的时间机器，盟军计划使用时间机器回到战争初期以摧毁尤里的心灵控制器。但是时间机器没有足够的电力启动，因此指挥官必须在城内占领发电厂。指挥官最后占领了足够的发电厂，尤里则直接叫出工程师将核反应堆修好准备启动心灵控制器，及时回到过去，但是指挥官到达的是在苏军攻势下的旧金山。尽管如此，盟军成功地在恶魔岛破坏了心灵控制器。因为这次时间旅行，苏军和尤里的计划被打乱。被炸死的卡维利将军安全无恙的存在。

    指挥官被派往被尤里控制的洛杉矶。盟军情报显示尤里不仅心灵控制了大部分市民，而且建造了几座部队回收厂，这种装置可以破坏一切物品，并转化为原料，以变成尤里的战争资金。其后，城市里的部队回收厂和其余的尤里军队都被击破，洛杉矶被解放了。

    损失惨重的尤里被迫在西雅图寻找新的收入来源，他以核武器将西雅图夷为平地作要胁，强迫巨软公司及其CEO宾尔（映射比尔·盖茨和微软公司）提供资金和研发基因软件。在接受宾尔的请求以后，卡维利将军命令指挥官解放西雅图。盟军迅速毁坏了该处的核弹发射井，解放了西雅图。巨软公司的CEO其后捐赠了一笔资金，对盟军的努力作为感谢。

    解放了西雅图后，尤里俘获了爱因斯坦教授，迫令他在埃及大金字塔附近的尤里基地对心灵控制器进行改进。指挥官迅速前往埃及解救了爱因斯坦，并毁坏尤里的心灵控制器和基地。（如果只解救爱因斯坦没有摧毁心灵控制器，爱因斯坦通报他入侵了心灵控制器，只能使用一次之后过一段时间会自动炸毁）

    尤里其后计划绑架世界主要国家的领导人和用对尤里忠诚的克隆人替换他们。卡维利将军命令指挥官去澳大利亚悉尼， 毁坏了尤里的克隆设施和军队。

    如同原来的时间线一样，苏联被盟军击败了，并且尤里的军队开始后退。在希望尽快结束战争的情况下，盟军和苏联开始合作对抗尤里。 双方在一个机密地点开始和平谈判，条约必须由双方批准和签字。但是当通知指挥官时，伊娃・李被尤里心灵控制并且告诉尤里和平会议的地点是英国伦敦国会大厦。 卡维利将军要指挥官不惜一切代价保卫国会大厦。条约最终签了字，并且增援的苏军加入战斗，尤里在伦敦的基地被夷平。

    原本伊娃少尉将情报泄漏之后向指挥官道歉并打算辞职，但卡维利将军立即阻止并答应原谅请她留下来。同时，盟军情报确定尤里在南极拥有最后一个心灵控制器和一个巨型的基地，他计划使用这基地展开他最后的攻击。盟军空降了一队工程师到火地岛的修理一个废弃的苏联前哨基地。基地在建立苏联雷达后，盟军总部其后使用超时空传送仪，传送一小队盟军部队到南极。在南极火速建立了一个盟军基地，并且完全歼灭尤里的巨型基地和心灵控制器。

    最后，盟军俘虏了尤里，将他关进爱因斯坦设计的心灵隔离室（Psychic Isolation Chamber）。突然时空副作用出现引起时间线融合，回到剧情从一次白宫的简报会开始，原本要发布尤里的恐怖计划变成了卡维利将军安然无恙的画面，而谭雅再庆功宴前打扮了一番，得意地问指挥官的感觉。随后伊娃少尉出现，谭雅自觉打扮得不如伊娃漂亮，于是打算找爱因斯坦博士借用时间机器“再来一次”（后来知晓会有副作用就没打算使用了）。

  <p align="justify">The Allies used Einstein's time machine to travel back in time and destroy the psychic dominator on Alcatraz while it was still under construction.

After their victory in San Francisco, Lt. Eva Lee got into contact with General Carville, who was still alive at the time. Lt. Eva then informed the Allied Commander that Yuri has taken over Hollywood, and has been breaking down mind-controlled civilians in the city using his Grinders to fund his army. The Commander's forces launched an attack on Hollywood and destroyed Yuri's base of operation there, liberating the city and denying Yuri a significant source of income.

At this point, Chariman Bing of the Massivesoft Corporation sent a distress call to Lt. Eva. He told them that Yuri's forces have built a nuclear missile silo, and is threatening to nuke Seattle unless Massivesoft funds his army. Yuri also forced Massivesoft's R&D department to work on a special project, apparently some form of genetic software. The Allies quickly moved into the city and destroyed the missile silo, once again cutting off Yuri's funds.

Unfortunately, Yuri has captured Professor Einstein, and forced him to improve his Psychic doinators in order to complete his psychic network sooner. The Allies tracked him to a secret base in Egypt, and agent Tanya successfully rescued him from the inside of a Pyramid. However, it was revealed that Yuri has constructed a massive base in Egypt, and the one where Einstein was kept was only a small base. With the help of a captured Psychic dominator, however, the Commander managed to demolish Yuri's base and liberate Egypt.

According to Allied intelligence, Yuri planned to kidnap Allied leaders and replace them with clones. Spy satellites revealed that the cloning facility is located in Sydney, Australia. In the end, the Commander's forces successfully destroyed the cloning facility and eliminate Yuri's forces in the city.

Thanks to the Allies' efforts, the outcome of the war stayed the same, and the Soviet Union was forced to surrender. However, with Yuri still at large, the leaders of the two powers have agreed to sign a treaty at a classified location, which would result in the Soviets joining the fight agaisnt Yuri. However, Yuri hacked into Lt. Eva's communications channel, and mind-controlled her into revealing the location of the treaty: the Houses of Parliament in London. This forced the Commander to quickly rush to London in order to protect the world leaders. Yuri sent waves after waves of his forces into London, but the Allied Commander managed to hold the line until the treaty was ratified, and successfully drove Yuri out of London with assistance from the Soviets.

Feeling that she was responsible for putting the whole world at risk, Lt. Eva planned to resign, but was stopped by General Carville. She successfully triangulated Yuri's location from his communications: Antarctica. It is also where Yuri's final Psychic dominator is located. The Commander's forces started their assault on Yuri's final base by capturing an abandoned Soviet base in Tierra del Fuego. They set up a Radar Tower and held off Yuri's forces long enough for an Allied MCV to be Chronoshifted in. Now armed with the arsenal of both powers, the Commander launched a devastating attack on the Psychic dominator, demolishing it and wiping out the last of Yuri's forces.

Yuri was captured by the Allies and imprisoned inside a Psychic Isolation Chamber invented by Einstein himself, where he "won't be able to mind-control a fly". Just as General Carville congratulates the Commander, the two timelines began to merge.

In the new timeline, instead of Yuri, it was General Carville who interrupted the emergency meeting at White House, much to the shock of President Dugan. Meanwhile, Tanya invited the Commander to the victory gala, just like she did in the previous timeline. However, she was interrupted by Lt. Eva this time, who also invited the Commander to attend. Tanya complained to Einstein that he didn't get the timeline straight, and asked to be sent back to two hours ago. She then, with a wink, told the Commander that she'll catch him on the replay.

  <h3>蘇軍劇情</h3>
  <p align="justify">
    苏联领导层发现盟军计划回到过去，他们意识到，如果他们能在旧金山夺取盟军的时间机器，苏联可能重新取得优势。苏军进入旧金山并设法夺取时间机器。但是时间机器没有足够的电力，因此将军（代表苏联指挥官，玩家）必须夺取四个发电厂（另外，尤里部队也再争夺发电厂并启动心灵控制器）。苏联控制了足够的发电厂之后，因为误操作而回到恐龙时期。 将军必须从霸王龙的攻击中保卫时间机器。安全的回到正确的过去之后，顺利的找到占据旧金山的苏军基地并成功摧毁了心灵控制器。

    苏军从未来把特殊文件带回到莫斯科通知苏联领导，苏联怎样输掉战争和尤里带来的威胁。 洛马诺夫总理命令将军去德国黑森林毁坏爱因斯坦的实验室和超时空传送仪的原型机（盟军关卡立场逆转）。将军及时地毁坏这个潜在的威胁，导致盟军在原先时间线中突袭莫斯科逼降苏联的计划告吹，双方被迫议和。

    尤里在英国伦敦建造了一个心灵信标，能心灵控制整个城市，并且那里的盟军部队被尤里控制了。将军前往伦敦解救盟军部队。但是尤里在伦敦还建立了一个基地和心灵控制器，不过苏联和盟军很快联手毁坏尤里的基地和军队。

    在这次胜利以后，出访的洛马诺夫总理的飞机被击落在摩洛哥卡萨布兰卡。 在尤里赶到之前，将军被派遣到卡萨布兰卡建立基地和抢救洛马诺夫。洛马诺夫在卡萨布兰卡唯一的机场登机回莫斯科。

    根据情报，将军被派到了太平洋上一个未知的海岛，尤里在此设了一个大型基地和建立了一大队雷鸣潜舰。在登上海岛以后，将军毁坏尤里的大型基地和所有他的残存部队。

    在战斗结束之后，在海岛上发现有火箭发射设施和一枚目的地是月球的火箭。苏联使用这种火箭，带领将军到月球，并毁坏尤里月球上的基地和指挥中心。

    尤里最终逃到在他的罗马尼亚祖籍地的一座城堡避难。洛马诺夫命令将军对尤里的藏身处展开攻击，将军发现尤里在该地建立了二个心灵信标，他使用被心灵控制的盟军和苏联军队攻击将军。将军建立了基地并且发动对尤里军队的一次大型攻击。将军顺利地破坏城堡。（如果难度中等以上，被控制的盟军和苏联军队会建造天气控制器和核弹发射井，尤里军队也建造了基因突变器和心灵控制器）

    然而，尤里本人夺取了时间机器和并打算回到过去，东山再起。佐菲雅事先改变了时间机器的目的地并释放机器所有的能源存量。尤里被困于恐龙时期，而且影片中暗示他被暴龙吃掉了。苏联控制了全世界，代表资本主义的股市也被取消，并开始全力发展太空技术，借此扩展共产主义到外太空……

  <p align="justify">In the Soviet campaign, the Commander is informed by Lt. Zofia and Premier Romanov (imprisoned in the Tower of London) of Yuri's activities and the Allied Time machine. He was then sent with a small force to San Francisco to capture the Allied time machine. The Soviets hijacked the time machine and used it to travel in time.

However, the Soviets unwittingly gave the time machine too much energy, and they arrived back in the age of the dinosaurs. The Soviets defended the time machine against T-Rexes while Zofia and the others attempted to fix the mistake. The Soviets finally arrived to the correct time, during the occupation of San Francisco, at the very brink of the Third World War. Taking over an existing Soviet base, they destroyed the Psychic Dominator while still under construction.

The Soviet forces from the future made it to Moscow, where they informed the past Premier Romanov of the Soviet defeat that was to take place, mentioning also Yuri's betrayal. The Commander is sent to the Black Forest in Germany to destroy Einstein's Laboratory and the Chronosphere to cripple the Allied war effort. This is essentially the same mission as Operation: Mirage in Red Alert 2, but from the perspective of the Soviets (hence the name Operation: Deja Vu). This time, the Soviets defeated the Allies. Shortly after, the Allies surrendered completely. They now fight with the Soviet Union against the traitor Yuri.

The Commander was sent to London to destroy Yuri's Psychic Dominator there, liberating a mind-controlled Allied base in the process. His triumph wasn't long, as Premier Romanov's plane was shot down above Morocco. Finding Romanov was the easy part (he was found partying with the locals), however Yuri's forces have entrenched themselves around the airport. The Commander destroyed Yuri's forces and evacuated the Premier from the airport.

After this victory, the he was sent to an uncharted island in the South Pacific which served as Yuri's submarine base. During the destruction of Yuri's headquarters there, it was revealed that Yuri has a launch facility on the island. The rocket was programmed to fly to the Moon. The Soviets used the rocket to send troops to the Moon in order to destroy Yuri's secret base there.

Facing certain defeat, Yuri took refuge in his ancestral castle in Transylvania. Two bases, one Allied and one Soviet, were already built there, but were mind-controlled by psychic beacons. The Commander easily destroyed them, liberated the two bases and razed the castle.

Yuri was revealed to be alive. He wasn't in the castle at the time, but has instead captured the time machine, telling the Commander: The whole world and all of its history is mine to command and conquer!

Lt. Zofia, recalling the experience of being stuck in the Cretaceous Period, quickly redirects the time machine there and deplete its power reserve. Yuri is stranded in time and is presumably eaten by a Tyrannosaurus Rex.

The Soviet Union imposed communism over the entire world and began to build on its space program, ready to expand their glorious cause into the rest of the solar system. </p>
