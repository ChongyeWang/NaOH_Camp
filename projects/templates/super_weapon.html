	<h3>Chronosphere</h3>

	<p align="justify">The Chronosphere was a mass teleportation device developed by the Allies during the Second World War. An improved version was used to decisively end the Third World War and was used further until the end of the Psychic Dominator Crisis. Albert Einstein was a notable contributor to the Chronosphere's design. </p>
	</div>
	
</div>

<div style="width: 900px; margin: 0 auto;">
	<br>
	<h3>Background</h3>
	<p align="justify">The Chronosphere continued to be improved by Albert Einstein at his Black Forest laboratory. The device could move much more mass spread over a wider area. In addition, the Chrono Vortex and personnel teleportation problems were eliminated. However, it still could not directly teleport infantry. </p>

	<h3>History</h3>
	<p align="justify">Both the Soviets and the Allies were impressed by the Chronosphere and its powers, but due to the various drawbacks it had (chrono vortex, loss of personnel in transport vehicles) Einstein decided to recreate it from scratch to make it even more powerful and remove the errors that made it almost a "danger" to be used during the preceding war. </p>

	<h5>Third World War</h5>
	<p align="justify">When the Soviets invaded the U.S. at the beginning of the Third World War, the project of the new Chronosphere was not yet started and could not help the Allies in the war against the Soviets. However, Einstein began working in secret at his lab in the Black Forest, Germany, for a new Chronosphere. Additionally Einstein developed other technologies for the Allies, such as Prism towers, Prism tanks, Mirage tanks and the ultimate Allied superweapon, the Weather Control Device, which was used in Operation: Chrono Storm.</p>
	<p align="justify">
	However, at one point the Soviets discovered of Einstein's experiments and, knowing that the Chronosphere was one of the things that made the Allies win the Second World War, decided to launch a full-scale assault on Germany by sending in three assault forces to wipe out all Allied presence in the area and eliminating Einstein. An Allied commander personally took care of the defense of Einstein's lab and forced the Soviets to retreat. </p>

	<p align="justify">Shortly afterwards, Einstein finally finished working on the new Chronosphere device. However, there was a problem. The Allies understood that invading the USSR like in the precedent war would be very costly in terms of funds and manpower, and decided to launch a Chrono invasion directly on Moscow to end the war quickly. But in order to do so, the Chronosphere had to be deployed in a precise location. Einstein took some time to find it - it was a small island in the Florida Keys, which was extremely close to a Soviet ally: Cuba. The same commander who saved Einstein in Germany took care of the operation. The worst had yet to happen, as the Allies found out Cuba had three nuclear silos that were prepared to fire at the United States, but Premier Romanov decided to use them on the small Allied base to destroy the Chronosphere. Before the strongest missiles were loaded in the silos, the Allied commander managed to teleport forces right behind them, ending the nuclear threat. </p>

	<p align="justify">With the Chronosphere safe and ready for use, the Allies launched a surprise chrono invasion on Moscow, teleporting troops in the middle of the city to establish a base and capture the Kremlin, where Romanov was commanding his forces. The Allied commander was also authorized to build a Chronosphere in the area and the Weather Control Device that devastated Soviet forces in the city. With the help of these two weapons, the Kremlin were surrounded and Romanov was captured. </p>

	<h5>Alternate Third World War</h5>

	<p align="justify">The Soviet Union has emerged victorious over the Allies. After their failed attempt to develop a Weather Control Device in the US Virgin Islands, effective Allied resistance to Soviet supremacy was limited to Alaska. With the defeat of Yuri and the reunification of the USSR under the new Premier, the Soviets were ready to turn their undivided attention to this one remaining obstacle to the ultimate triumph of communism in the world.</p>

	<p align="justify">
	Files recovered from a hidden archive in the Kremlin gave the location of an Allied Chronosphere in Point Hope, Alaska, which allowed the Allies to strike anywhere on the planet. The location of this last Chronosphere device was the Allies' best kept secret - it was all they had left. Nevertheless, Yuri somehow managed to locate it, but failed to inform the rest of the Soviet army. </p>

	<p align="justify">
		The Soviet commander defeated all Allied forces in the area and destroyed the Chronosphere with a nuclear strike, removing the last obstacle from winning the war. 
	</p>

	<h5>Psychic Dominator Disaster</h5>

	<p align="justify">
		After the Third World War, the Chronosphere remained untouched in the Allied arsenal, as it was believed to be an almost perfect weapon. With the Soviet Union defeated, it seemed for the Allies that there was no longer need to utilize it, but they were wrong. 
	</p>

	<p align="justify">
		When Yuri emerged with his own army and gave an ultimatum to President Dugan, explaining his plan to conquer the world using his Psychic Dominators, the President ordered an air strike to the Psychic Dominator located on Alcatraz Island. The airstrike failed to destroy the Dominator but damaged the nuclear reactor, preventing the device from coming online. The situation was still critical, as the other Dominators were activated and the world would have soon fell under his control. The Allies quickly called Einstein, who had a plan to stop Yuri. He heavily retro-modified one of the Chronospheres in San Francisco: instead of moving mass through space, this modified Chronosphere moved it through time, acting effectively as a time machine. 
	</p>

	<p align="justify">
		Discovering the device, Yuri quickly ordered his forces to destroy it, but heavy resistance allowed the Allies to capture various civilian power plants in the city to power the time machine up and go back in time, when the Third World War was just beginning. The Chronosphere was also used various times during the new war against Yuri, with the most notable occasion being the assault on Yuri's last stronghold in Antarctica, where combined Allied and Soviet forces defeated Yuri and destroyed the last remaining Psychic Dominator. Once again, the Chronosphere was what made the Allies win the war. 
	</p>

	<h5>War of the Three Powers </h5>

	<p align="justify">
		Even though Einstein was removed from time by the Soviets, the Chronosphere somehow remained in the Allied arsenal of War of the Three Powers. It was developed by FutureTech instead of Albert Einstein, with the help of some of Einstein's work made before Cherdenko killed him in 1927. 
	</p>

	<h3>In-game</h3>

	<p align="justify">The Chronosphere may move any ground and/or sea units in a 3x3 square area. While it is somewhat tricky to target the teleporting effect, it is still possible to teleport the maximum of 9 units to a clear location. Unlike the Iron Curtain device, the Chronosphere is a powerful offensive weapon as well: teleporting a sea unit onto land (or vice versa) destroys the unit at the destination, unless the unit is amphibious. </p>

	<p align="justify">Chronoshifting infantry, including commandos, is lethal. This property can be used to eliminate large groups of infantry or threatening commandos in an instant. However, infantry units using Chrono technology to move while inside a transport will survive, and will be instantly transported to the location instead of dying. </p>

	<p align="justify">Units may not be teleported onto impassable terrain like cliffs, buildings or an area overpopulated by terrain objects (such as trees and lamp posts), as they will instantly explode as they arrive. This can be used offensively, by teleporting enemy units to water, for example (or even ships to ground, in both cases, instantly destroying them).

	</p>

	<p align="justify">
	A game bug will constantly allow a computer-controlled enemy to teleport its tanks atop each other if the teleport destination is a cramped area, meaning that a single field on the map will be occupied by 3-4 tanks at the same time. Strangely, the game still differentiates between the 3-4 tanks, so a single shot on one will not damage all of them at once.

	<h3>Weather Control Device</h3>

	<p align="justify">The weather control device (or weather machine), was an Allied superweapon used during the Third World War and its second iteration, designed by Albert Einstein as a weapon of last resort. </p>
	</div>
	
</div>

<br>


<div style="width: 900px; margin: 0 auto;">

<h3>
	Description 
</h3>

<p align="justify">
	
	Because the Allies' stockpile of nuclear weapons were destroyed by the Soviets at the start of their invasion of the United States, Professor Albert Einstein invented a new superweapon for the Allies to counter the Soviets' own nuclear missiles. Interestingly enough, Einstein initially didn't want the device used believing that it was "God's Toys", but he relented when he decided that the ends justified the means (i.e. ending the Soviet Union as a threat to the free world). This also later applied to Yuri and his minions.</p>
<p align="justify">

	It could manipulate the weather patterns to create a powerful lightning storm. The lightning bolts could destroy heavily armoured structures. Interestingly enough, the more surface area that a building occupied, the more likely that it would be destroyed. Therefore, structures such as war factories, although significantly armored, could be easily destroyed. However, structures such as sentry guns, though they had low health, were much more likely to survive the storm, owing to their small surface area. The Weather Control Device also disables all allied and enemy radar for the full duration of the storm.</p>
<p align="justify">

	Interestingly, on a skirmish map with multiple Allies players owning this superweapon, a lightning storm couldn't be created if another is already active (the few seconds between the time it was targeted and it dissipated). </p>


<h3>
	Counters
</h3>

<p align="justify">
	
	There was really only one counter, and that was to destroy the weapon before it could be used. Its effect, however, could be postponed by sabotaging the power by a Spy, or taking out power plants. A Spy could effectively reset the Weather Controller's timer also. Once launched, a devastating lightning storm would form, and short of vacating the area of effect or deploying an Iron Curtain or Force Shield to make the affected area invulnerable, there was no way to withstand the lightning storm's barrage. Fortunately, the weapon was expensive, and it took 10 minutes to recharge and deploy. There was approximately 12 second delay before the lightning storm cloud were visible. 2 seconds after that, the lightning bolts commenced. Also, a Weather Control Device could not be destroyed instantly with a direct hit from any of the three superweapons. 
</p>


<h3>
	Usage 
</h3>

<p align="justify">
	
	<p>
	It was deployed during the final battle against Romanov during the final battle of Third World War, as well as several times during the war against Yuri, that followed immediately after, particularly in the incident surrounding the threatened nuclear strike against the city of Seattle.</p>

	<p>
	In the Soviet campaign, the Allies deployed their Weather Control Device in the US Virgin Islands in a desperate attempt to counter the Soviet onslaught. This superweapon was modified to trade power (enough to 'level entire cities') for armor so only one well-timed nuclear missile was sufficient to destroy the weapon. 
	</p>

</p>

<h3>
	Post-War  
</h3>

<p align="justify">
	
	<p>
	After the war, the Allies reviewed the performance of this Structure. While the superweapon was powerful, it was very costly in terms of funds and power to maintain the structure in the battlefield. For this reason, the Allies deployed some Weather Control Devices around the globe and allowed an Allied Commander to use it once a Defense HQ was deployed, instead of having to construct the superweapon during the battle itself. </p>

	<p>
	Because Einstein designed the Weather Control Device the Allies did not have this superweapon by the time of the War of the Three Powers. Instead the Allied military company FutureTech developed the Proton Collider.

	<h3>Iron Curtain</h3>

	<p align="justify">The Iron Curtain was a Soviet super weapon that saw use in the Third World War. Technically speaking it was the second version of a weapon of the same name that was used in Second World War, making it the "Iron Curtain Mk.II." Like its predecessor, the Mk. II was able to render non-infantry/non-aerial units and structures invincible for a short period of time. </p>
	</div>
	
</div>

<br>

<div style="width: 900px; margin: 0 auto;">


<h3>
	Background  
</h3>


<p align="justify">
	The first Iron Curtain was a very effective weapon and had become a staple of the Red Army during the Second World War, but it still boasted many flaws. The greatest of its shortcomings was its limitation of "sheathing" only one unit at a time, after which it had to recharge its energy stores for several minutes. This problem significantly weakened the first Curtain's strategic viability, often to the frustration of Soviet commanders. 
</p>

<p align="justify">
	After gaining the lofty position of Premier, Alexander Romanov issued many reforms to the Red Army, among them an order to redesign and upgrade the Iron Curtain for the coming assault on the west. Responding to his order rapidly, Soviet technicians labored for several years trying to increase the Curtain's energy output in order to make it more combat effective in the modern battlefield. The end result of their labors was the Iron Curtain MkII, a new version of the classic weapon that used a very simple solution to solve its predecessors' problems; it was bigger. 
</p>

<p align="justify">
	By having greater size and volume, the new Curtain was not only able to cover up to nine individual vehicles at once, but it was also able to protect them longer. Its energy output was so much higher than the MkI that the red tinted energy it covered its targets in was thickened to the point that it turned black, though red flashes could still be seen whenever the field was struck by weapons fire. Like the MkI, this coloration would vanish when the Curtain's effect wore off. The Curtain could now protect buildings as well, though not as many as the energy shields developed during the Psychic Dominator Disaster. With these improvements the Iron Curtain was now a vastly more viable weapon, allowing Soviet Commanders to turn entire companies of tanks invincible long enough to devastate enemy fortifications and formations. 
</p>

<p align="justify">
	Not all of the original Curtain's flaws were ironed out however. The MkII was still unable to sheath air units, making Kirov airships and later airborne Siege Choppers ineligible for targeting, although the latter could be sheathed if deployed. Also, the greater energy output of made the curtains power lethal to infantry and dogs, crushing them under its own power, unless garrisoned inside buildings or transports (if deployed, however, infantry couldn't re-enter the structure or transport until the effect wore off). But the user may use that to one's advantage by killing clusters of enemy infantry and dogs. 
</p>


<p align="justify">
	The new Curtain physically resembled the original in many ways, with a large metal sphere at its apex, a wide metal base, and arcs of energy crackling from the base to the sphere. The ball shared the size and appearance of those used in the Tesla Reactor, the only difference being the Iron Curtain's black/red color and the Tesla's silver/blue color. The most notable difference in respect of its predecessor was its greater size, being almost two times as large as the first Curtain. 
</p>


<p align="justify">
	It was redesigned in the War of the Three Powers, with its ball encased in armour and doesn't float anymore. 
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<p align="justify">The basic tactics surrounding the new Iron Curtain changed little from Second World War to Third World War. Commanders would target friendly units and render them invincible long enough to fight without fear of damage by their enemies. However with its new attributes the Curtain could also defend buildings, making it possible to render valuable buildings invulnerable in a pinch. This was something that was very appreciated by the Red Army when it was used in combination with a base energy shield, especially during a super weapon assault. Also, the Curtain's infantry crushing capability was occasionally used practically, destroying large swathes of enemy soldiers in a single blow. One rather unexpected benefit of the Curtain's protection was that it rendered units invulnerable to Psychic Control, allowing Soviet armor to overcome Yuri's many mind control tricks easily. A particularly nasty tactic was to combine the Iron Curtain with several Demolition Trucks, which would allow a commander to position them to eliminate a large portion of an enemy base. If Demolition Trucks are not available, another tactic was to build Flak tracks, and fill them with Terrorists before using the Iron Curtain. The Tracks were then rushed into the enemy base, before deploying the terrorists inside the base. The Tracks can then safely exit the enemy base. </p>

<p align="justify">If Iron Curtain is used on a group of heavily armored vehicles when attacking, it can also distract enemy's defenses within its duration. While the defensive units/buildings are busy with the invulnerable tanks, other units would have a chance to deal large damage. </p>

<h3>Counters </h3>

<p align="justify">As is the case with many superweapons, there is no hard counter. A Force Shield could be deployed on friendly structures to attempt to minimize losses, but the invincible units are just that; invincible. A multiple layered wall can be deployed to buy more time in base defence against it, but it require well planned building management and resource with consideration to terrain available and theater. </p>

<p align="justify">A cynical, but cost-ineffective counter could be the Chronosphere, which would allow teleporting the invulnerable enemy units to water or impassable terrain, instantly destroying them. </p>

	<h3>Nuclear Missile Silo</h3>

	<p align="justify">The nuclear silo was a large linear enclosed structure similar to a tall hanger that was heavily-armored, and intended to construct, prepare, and launch tactical nuclear missile. If the missile launched, any and all hostiles in the nuclear missile's ground zero blast zone immediately felt the devastating horrors of nuclear weaponry. It saw service with the Soviets during Third World War. They were designed to be armored heavily enough to withstand a direct nuclear weapon hit on their own position, and still be able to fire their own nuclear weapons. The design was a much more improved version of the old Missile Silo. </p>
	</div>
	
</div>




<div style="width: 900px; margin: 0 auto;">
<h3>Deployment History</h3>

<h5>Pre-Third World War</h5>

<p align="justify">Before the Third World War the United States built several nuclear silos, modelled after old Second World War design, including one facility with at least three operational silos known to contain at least 10 nuclear missiles as deterrence against a full-scale attack. However, when the time came to use it, nuclear retaliation failed due to Soviet sabotage of the presidential authorization line to the silos by the psychic Yuri. Yuri used the line to mind control the operators, having them launch the missiles but leave the silo doors closed, effectively declawing the Allied forces a chance to give the Union a taste of their own medicine. </p>

<p align="justify">However, the Soviets had many smaller Silos that they deployed on many occasions. </p>


<h5>Third World War</h5>

<p align="justify">Its most notable use during the war was in the nuclear attack that destroyed Chicago entirely using a Nuclear Fusion warhead, as opposed to the typical fission warheads. The fusion warheads had explosive power in the megatons, as opposed to the fission warhead's kilotons. The explosion toppled the city's vast skyline and its signature Sears Tower; cars were swept by the shockwave like sticks in a tornado, structures either collapsed, incinerated, or were sent flying off their foundations, and people were nothing more than their permanently etched shadows on the walls. However, fusion missiles generate much less radiation, thus Chicago was not a total loss. Still, the Commander's forces who had just succeeded in destroying the Psychic Amplifier were crushed in the attack. </p>

<p align="justify">The Soviet Union also deployed a pair of nuclear silos on the German-Polish border which housed medium-range ballistic missiles as a means of blackmail against Western Europe, threatening to annihilate their cities if they attempted to lend any assistance to their American allies. Shocked and shaken by the destruction of Chicago, the Europeans agreed to assist the Americans, but only after they destroyed the nuclear silos threatening their cities. The Americans deployed Agent Tanya behind enemy lines to destroy the silos, and eventually succeeded in destroying both silos. With the Soviet Union's means of nuclear blackmail ruined, the Europeans declared open war on the Soviets and rushed to America's aid. </p>

<p align="justify">A trio of nuclear silos based in Soviet Cuba was also used against the Allied base in the Florida Keys while they were developing the Chronosphere. Premier Romanov was sure these missiles would spell doom for the Commander, but to his outrage, the Commander proved defiant and demolished the Soviet base and its silos, ensuring the safety of the Chronosphere and the Allies' ultimate victory in Moscow. </p>

<p align="justify">The Soviets maintained a single nuclear silo within Moscow during the Allied assault on the city. The Soviets were prepared to nuke their own capital in the event of an Allied invasion, but the Americans ultimately destroyed the silo and overran Romanov's defenses around the Kremlin. Thus, not even the Union's vast nuclear arsenal could save it from total defeat. </p>

<p align="justify">The commander gained the nuclear command codes from the Soviet command for use against the Allies' "strange" superweapon, the Weather Control Device. </p>

<p align="justify">It proved to be a major factor in Red Revolution as Yuri was forced to throw anything he had at the silo (Yuri likely did not have nuclear command codes and used the Iron Curtain instead). However, the Commander used them to purify the Kremlin from Yuri. </p>

<p>It was later used to destroy the last fully operational Chronosphere in Alaska, securing total victory over the Allies. </p>

<h5>Psychic Dominator Disaster</h5>

<p>During the Psychic Dominator Disaster, Yuri seized one of the Soviet nuclear missile silos and threatened Seattle in an effort to force Chairman Bing, CEO of Massivesoft, to fund his operations. </p>


<h5>War of the Three Powers</h5>

<p align="justify">
	Due to the damage caused to the timeline by the erasure of Albert Einstein at the hands of Soviet premier Anatoly Cherdenko, and the fact that Einstein was partly responsible for nuclear technology, the Nuclear Silo no longer exists, paving the way for the new Vacuum Imploder. 
</p>

<h3>Trivia </h3>

<p align="justify">The Soviet nuclear missile that can be launched from this Silo looks practically identical to the real-life R-7 "Semyorka" (NATO reporting name SS-6 Sapwood) missile developed in the 1950s by the Soviet Union. It was the world's first intercontinental ballistic missile ever built. Its modified form launched Sputnik 1, the first artificial satellite, into orbit. </p>

	<h3>Genetic Mutator</h3>

	<p align="justify">The device could turn any infantry unit, Yuri's or the opponent's, into a mindless brute, by manipulating their DNA. Non-humanoid infantry units were instantaneously killed, as the mutation process was only designed to function on humans. Some of the software technology came from Massivesoft which Yuri blackmailed into writing a genetic software which presumably formed the basis of the weapon; due to the fact that in the original timeline he wasn't interrupted, it is probable that the pre-time travel version was even more powerful.</p>
	</div>
	
</div>

<br>

<div style="width: 900px; margin: 0 auto;">
<h3>Counters</h3>


<p align="justify">It took a long time to build up the energy necessary to turn such a huge amount of forces into brutes. Also, placing infantry into a vehicle or garrisoning a structure protected them from the Genetic Mutator's effects. For the same reason, it was completely ineffective against vehicles and structures, should it be used against them. The mutagenic energy burst seems to be focused at ground level, therefore, Rocketeers are also immune to its effect.</p>

<h3>Usage</h3>

<p align="justify">The Genetic Mutator was useful as a means of destroying enemy infantry attacks, answering infantry rushes efficiently. Furthermore, the Genetic Mutator could be used to convert inexpensive units, such as initiates, into the more powerful brutes, saving a significant amount of credits. The Genetic Mutator can also be used on Slaves, which were free to produce. The mutant slaves could then be sent into the grinder for a large sum of credits.</p>

<p align="justify">This weapon can turn even Boris and Tanya into brutes. The only way to stop it from happening is to garrison infantry into vehicles like the Flak Track and the IFV, or any garrisonable structure. However, for whatever reason, the weapon wasn't calibrated to work on non-humans. Giant squids, dolphins and attack dogs were immune to mutation, however in the process, they would die. Due to the psychic technology imbued to the weapon other brutes would be converted to whichever side exposing the mutator ray.</p>

<p align="justify">A counter for the Genetic Mutator is to reduce the usage of infantry (except rocketeers) or garrison them in available structures. This tactic is less favorable to the Allies, as they have superior infantry corps compared to the Soviets. To reduce damage, it is advised to place a small amount of infantry (ungarrisoned) near defensive structures, luring the enemy to fire at those, rather than more valuable targets. Spies are able to reset the weapon's timer or sabotage its power supply, providing a window during which to make an infantry assault.</p>

<p align="justify">AIs tend to use it on Slave Miners and clusters of infantry either friendly or hostile.</p>

<p align="justify">A good tactic is to target enemy infantry that groups(like GI, Guardian GI's) and destroy the defenses or structure easilly.</p>

	<h3>Psychic dominator</h3>

	<p align="justify">The psychic dominator was Yuri's superweapon from the Third World War, developed as a trump card with which he intended to conquer the world. Once activated over a designated area, all enemy units caught in the blast zone were immediately and permanently mind-controlled.</p>
	</div>
	
</div>

<br>

<div style="width: 900px; margin: 0 auto;">
<h3>Description</h3>

<p align="justify">
	The device could store extreme amounts of psychic power, and then release it to mind control a group of units or vehicles in an area, though this required a significant energy input. When the device is nearly charged, the device opens and the contraption atop of it, which holds the lids on the device, rises, resembling a hand controlling a puppet.
</p>

<p align="justify">
	The original design enabled the full conversion of energy into a complete psychic wave. This setup was designed that the psychic dominator will simply release the wave in a very large area, surpassing the psychic beacon and was possibly on par with the psychic amplifier. Yuri created a network of psychic dominators scattered across the globe as a reserve plan in the case of the Soviet invasion's failure. However, time travel has significantly altered the design of the device. As Yuri discovered the Allied forces who travelled back in time to stop him, he did not have enough time to complete it according to plan. He kidnapped Albert Einstein and ordered him to help perfect the psychic dominator technology. While a rescue team was searching for him, Einstein sabotaged a psychic dominator in Egypt, and after he was saved, the device was utilized with lower performance but with balanced side effect.
</p>

<p align="justify">
	Once charged up, it would send out a wave of psychic energy that could completely conquer human minds in small area (on par with chronosphere and Iron Curtain ranges). It also unleashed raw psychic power that would deal significant damage to the surrounding buildings, but was harmless to units.s
</p>

<h3>Counters</h3>

<p align="justify">
	As with other superweapons of the era, the psychic dominator's weakness was its requirement for large amounts of power. It could be delayed from firing if the base's power was knocked out. Furthermore, the device was extremely expensive, and although heavily armoured, was unarmed save for the massive psychic domination, which was not an effective weapon for direct defense. A spy could also reset the weapon's timer, provided he could penetrate the base.
</p>

<p align="justify">
	An effective tactic against the AI would be to send a lot of cheap infantry somewhere away from your base. The AI would fire at those infantry, sparing your base (as long as they do not use the genetic mutator instead). Base defenses could then mop them up. In easy or medium difficulty, if you have not built up yet your army, and have no units in your base, the AI simply will not target your base with the psychic dominator blast.
</p>


<h3>Deployment</h3>

<p align="justify">A network of multiple psychic dominators (and according to the map intro likely a few dozen psychic beacons around the world) were used to conquer the minds of almost everyone on Earth during the Psychic Dominator Disaster.</p>

<p align="justify">After the war, Soviet time travel carried out by Premier Anatoly Cherdenko erased this superweapon from existence. However, the technological cult of the Empire of the Rising Sun had developed a similar weapon - Psionic Decimator. While this lacked the power to mind control enemies, its psychic power could cause significant destruction.</p>


<h3>In-game</h3>

<p align="justify">In-game, the psychic dominator had a seemingly small blast radius, equal to that of the Allied Chronosphere or Soviet Iron Curtain. All units caught in the radius would be permanently mind controlled (they could never be freed or mind controlled by an opposing Yuri player). The blast radius of the accompanying destructive wave, however, is actually similar to the one of a nuclear missile or a lightning storm (despite the discrepancy with the psychic wave's radius), causing similar carnage.</p>

<p align="justify">Like all other psychic units and structures, the dominator could not control any vehicles affected by the Iron Curtain.</p>
