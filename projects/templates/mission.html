<p align="justify">The Soviet invasion of the American mainland took the USA by surprise but not the European leaders. As Soviet invaders pour into the country from every conceivable direction, the Allied military desperately tried to defend itself from the aggressors. One of the key elements of the invasion was New York City, hit especially hard due to its strong propaganda values.

With most of the military commanders dead, only one was able to respond to the President's Lazarus Protocol, an emergency directive to be activated in the event of an invasion. Coming under the command of General Carville, the Commander was placed in command of every man, woman and child in the Eastern United States and sent to New York City to blunt the Soviet invasion.</p>

<p align="justify">苏联对美国大陆的入侵使美国感到惊讶，但欧洲领导人却没有。 当苏联入侵者从各种可能的方向涌入该国时，盟军拼命地为自己防御侵略者。 入侵的关键因素之一是纽约市，由于其强大的宣传价值，遭受的打击尤其严重。 在大多数军事指挥官死亡的情况下，只有一个人能够对总统的《拉撒路议定书》作出回应，这是在发生入侵事件时启动的紧急指示。 在卡维尔将军的指挥下，司令官被任命为美国东部每个男人，女人和孩子的指挥官，并被送往纽约市以遏制苏联的入侵。</p>

<h3  style="font-weight: bold;">Guide</h3>
<p align="justify">The mission opens with Soviet Dreadnoughts assaulting the Statue of Liberty. Immediately select Tanya and and have her target the Dreadnoughts one after the other. She'll dispatch them in short order. Next the Statue will be assaulted by a group of Conscripts followed by a group of Paratroopers. While the GIs will be able to fend off these troops, the Statue of Liberty is a goner and there's nothing you can do about it.

After you fend off this assault, un-deploy the GIs and head across the bridge to the northwest. You'll find some GIs under attack by some Conscripts - take them out. The quickest way to do this is to use Tanya to target each Conscript one by one. Don't worry if you don't save the GIs, it is not vital to the mission.

Head to the northeast, where you'll find more Paratroopers. Kill them off and head east.

You'll soon reach an ore field - deploy your GIs near the field to protect your Chrono Miner. Send Tanya into the base just to the southeast of the ore field. This will give you control of the base and complete one of your objectives.

Immediately build a barracks and when it is ready, create an Engineer and then start cranking out GIs. When the Engineer is ready, use him to repair the bridge by left-clicking on one of the small buildings at the bridge's entrance.

Send Tanya and your newly created GIs across the bridge. Use Tanya to target the Conscripts and have your GIs take out the V3s. Target the oil barrels next and let them do their damage. Use your GIs en masse to take out the two Sentry Guns while Tanya targets the buildings in the Soviet base one by one. When all the buildings are destroyed, the mission is complete.</p>

<p align="justify">任务从苏维埃无畏战役袭击自由女神像开始。立即选择Tanya，将她的目标一个接一个地无畏。她会尽快将它们发送出去。接下来，雕像将被一群应征者殴打，随后将被一群伞兵袭击。虽然GI能够抵御这些部队，但自由女神像是行者，您对此无能为力。抵制这次袭击后，请取消部署GI，然后越过通往西北的桥梁。您会发现某些GI受某些应征者的攻击-将其取出。最快的方法是使用Tanya逐一定位每个应征者。如果您不保存地理标志，请不要担心，这对任务至关重要。前往东北，在那里您会发现更多伞兵。杀死他们然后向东走。您很快就会到达一个矿石场-在该场附近部署GI，以保护您的Chrono Miner。将Tanya发送到刚好位于矿场东南方的基地。这将使您可以控制基础并完成您的目标之一。立即建立营房，准备就绪后，创建一名工程师，然后开始制定GI。工程师准备好后，请用鼠标左键单击桥梁入口处的一栋​​小建筑物，用他来修复桥梁。在桥上发送Tanya和您新创建的GI。使用Tanya定位应征者，让您的GI删除V3。接下来对准油桶，让它们造成损坏。大量使用您的GI来消灭两支哨兵枪，而Tanya则一一瞄准了苏联基地中的建筑物。当所有建筑物都被摧毁后，任务就完成了。</p>

<p align="justify">Although the operation in New York blunts the invasion and the Allies bought some time to establish a foothold against the ongoing invasion, elsewhere Soviet forces continues to occupy more and more American territory. No help from America's European allies was to be expected, as they were being held hostage by Soviet nuclear warheads targeting their cities. The President makes a move to ask for help from the Allied leaders in Europe to convince them to come to the aid of the American people, a move not too well received by the patriotic General Carville who does not love the idea of the US asking for help. Despite his misgivings, he knew that this might tip the scales in their favor, but he had other concerns about the Soviets.

General Vladimir's forces were freely rampaging through inland America. As General Carville briefs the commander on the need to defend the Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, Tanya interrupts, informing that the base had been captured by the Soviets. Subsequently, the General orders the base to be recaptured, making a small jab at Tanya, just to see her rage (to his own amusement).</p>

<p align="justify">尽管纽约的行动使入侵变得平淡，同盟国花了一些时间来建立立足点，以抵御正在进行的入侵，但在其他地方，苏军仍继续占领越来越多的美国领土。预计美国的欧洲盟友不会提供帮助，因为它们被瞄准他们城市的苏联核弹头扣为人质。总统此举是向欧洲盟国领导人寻求帮助，以说服他们帮助美国人民，爱国将军卡维尔（Carville）不喜欢美国提出的要求，但此举不太令人满意。救命。尽管他有疑虑，但他知道这可能会使天平对他们有利，但他对苏维埃还有其他担忧。弗拉基米尔将军的军队在美国内陆自由扩张。当卡维尔将军向司令官介绍捍卫科罗拉多斯普林斯空军学院的必要性时，塔尼亚（Tanya）打断了，并告知基地已被苏军占领。随后，将军命令重新夺回基地，在坦妮亚（Tanya）进行一次小戳刺，只是为了看到她的愤怒（自娱自乐）。</p>

<h3 style="font-weight: bold;">Guide</h3>
<p align="justify">As the mission opens, you'll immediately see a few Conscripts running along a road just to the northeast. You can take them out quickly with Tanya. You will then be joined by a group of Rocketeers. Leave the Rocketeers, GIs, and Engineers behind for now and take Tanya to the northwest along the road.

Soon you will reach a Soviet base, but don't head right for it. There are Sentry Guns posted at its corners that will shred Tanya apart. Instead send her into the small lake at the front of the base (Tanya can swim and apparently is immune to hypothermia). From the lake, you can pick off the Conscripts near the base's entrance. Next swim to the other side, and plant charges on the two Flak Cannons just inside the base's entrance. After they are destroyed, send Tanya back into the safety of the lake.

With the Flak Cannons out of the picture, you can now bring up your Rocketeers to take out the Sentry Guns and any remaining Conscripts. Be careful that they do not begin to shoots at the other structures in the base - you'll want to capture those with your Engineers.

At this point, more Engineers will be air dropped into your base. Use these and the Engineers that you had from the start of the mission to capture all of the buildings in the base. Once you have done this, immediately begin creating GIs. As the GIs are ready, send them to just outside the base's southeast entrance and have them deploy. They should be able to handle the initial Soviet Conscript assaults and protect your base.

While building GIs, take your Rocketeers and fly them to the map's far northwest corner. Here you will find a small encampment of Conscripts that will be easy pickings for your Rocketeers. After you clear out the Conscripts, fly your Rocketeers back to base.

Once you have ten or so GIs, switch to Rocketeer production. Create another five or so and have them join your existing Rocketeers. Next take your Rocketeers to the east edge of the map. There is a Soviet base near this edge of the map, but all of its Flak defense is at the west entrance to the base. Fly your Rocketeers to the base's east side and begin to destroy the base's buildings and any Conscripts and tanks you happen to see. Have them move slowly westward, destroying the base as they move along.

While your Rocketeers are at work, build a group of three or four Grizzlies and then send them toward the base. Have them take out the base's wall near the west most Flak Cannon and then the Cannon itself. Fly some Rocketeers in from this direction to take out the Sentry Gun, but be careful to keep out of range of the other Flak Cannon. With the Sentry Gun eliminated, you can now maneuver the Grizzlies to work on the other Flak Cannon. The base is now safe for your Rocketeers to mop up. Soon there will be a massive airdrop of GIs and the mission will end.

There are some trucks in the map's southeast corner which can be destroyed to reveal power-up creates, but there's no real need to waste your time trying to reach them.

</p>

<p align="justify">任务开始执行后，您会立即看到一些应征者，正向东北方向行驶。您可以与Tanya一起快速将它们取出。然后，您将被一群Rocketeers加入。现在暂时离开火箭队，地理标志和工程师，然后将Tanya沿道路西北移。不久您将到达苏联基地，但不要为此而去。哨兵枪在其角落张贴，将Tanya撕成碎片。而是将她送入基地前部的小湖中（Tanya会游泳，显然对体温过低免疫）。从湖上，您可以在基地入口附近挑选应征者。接下来游泳到另一侧，在基地入口内的两架高炮上发射炸药。它们被摧毁后，将Tanya送回湖中。随着高射炮的出现，您现在可以调出火箭兵来拿出哨兵和任何剩余的应征者。请注意，它们不会开始对基地中的其他建筑物开火-您需要与工程师一起捕获它们。此时，更多的工程师将被空投到您的基地。使用这些任务以及您从任务开始就拥有的工程师来捕获基地中的所有建筑物。完成此操作后，立即开始创建GI。地理标志准备就绪后，将其发送到基地东南入口以外的地方并进行部署。他们应该能够处理最初的苏联兵应征突袭并保护您的基地。在构建GI时，带上您的Rocketeers并将其飞到地图的西北角。在这里，您会发现一小部分应征者，这对于您的Rocketeers来说是个轻松的选择。清除应征者后，将您的Rocketeers飞回基地。一旦拥有十个左右的GI，就切换到Rocketeer生产。再创建五个，让他们加入您现有的Rocketeers。接下来，将您的Rocketeers带到地图的东边缘。在地图的此边缘附近有一个苏联基地，但其所有的高射防御都在基地的西入口。将您的Rocketeers飞到该基地的东侧，开始摧毁该基地的建筑物以及您碰巧看到的所有应征者和坦克。让它们缓慢地向西移动，沿着它们的前进摧毁基地。当您的火箭队工作时，建立三到四个灰熊小组，然后将它们送到基地。让他们从最西端的Flak Cannon基地附近的墙壁中取出，然后从Cannon本身中取出。从这个方向飞来一些火箭兵，以拿出哨兵枪，但要小心，不要在其他高射炮的射程之外。消除了哨兵后，您现在就可以操纵灰熊在另一架Flak Cannon上工作。现在，基地是安全的，可以让您的火箭弹扫地。很快将有大量的GI空投，任务将结束。在地图的东南角，有一些卡车可以被破坏以显示动力产生的结果，但实际上并不需要浪费时间试图到达它们。</p>

<p align="justify">Although the Soviets had suffered a number of setbacks in their initial invasion of the United States, their momentum continued largely undeterred. While they lost ground in Colorado Springs, they struck yet another major blow against the U.S. government. During their invasion of the U.S. East Coast, the Soviets managed assert their full control over the capital through psychic control. In an attempt to win the war without any further resistance, Yuri and his Psychic Corps deployed a Psychic Beacon in front of the White House, placing the President, his cabinet, and all surviving military staff under firm mind control. The President declared that the American people pledge allegiance to Premier Romanov and General Ben Carville informed the Commander (who had not been brainwashed) that the war was over.

Fortunately for the unaffected American forces, the Commander and Lt. Eva Lee were unaffected by the Psychic Beacon, as they had been outside of the city at the time of its capture. Eva informed the Commander that if they could destroy the Beacon, they could safely evacuate the President and his staff to a secure location. She put him in touch with the unaffected American troops and the Commander moved swiftly to launch an attack on the Beacon.</p>

<p align="justify">尽管苏维埃在最初入侵美国时遭受了许多挫折，但他们的势头在很大程度上并未受到遏制。当他们在科罗拉多斯普林斯（Colorado Springs）失守时，他们又对美国政府造成了又一次重大打击。在入侵美国东海岸期间，苏联人设法通过心理控制来宣称对首都的完全控制。为了在没有任何进一步抵抗的情况下赢得战争，尤里和他的通灵军在白宫前部署了通航信标，将总统，内阁和所有幸存的军事人员置于坚定的思想控制之下。总统宣布美国人民宣誓效忠罗曼诺夫总理，本·卡维尔将军告知指挥官（未洗脑）战争已经结束。对于未受影响的美军来说，幸运的是，指挥官和伊娃·李中尉并未受到心灵信标的影响，因为他们在被俘时已经不在城里。伊娃告诉司令官，如果他们可以摧毁灯塔，他们可以安全地将总统和他的人员撤离到安全的地方。她让他与未受影响的美军保持联系，而指挥官迅速采取行动，向灯塔发起攻击。</p>

<h3 style="font-weight: bold;">Guide</h3>
<p align="justify">You begin this mission with a lot of GIs, a few Engineers, and an MCV. Deploy your MCV immediately and have it create an Ore Refinery, a Power Plant, a Barracks, a War Factory, and an Air Force Command, in that order. While creating these structures, take you GIs and garrison the buildings out side your base. Concentrate on the buildings on the east side, near the river, because most assaults will originate across the bridges leading to your base.

Use you Engineers to repair the heavily damaged buildings, so that your GIs can continue to receive the benefit of their protection. Use one Engineer to repair the Jefferson Memorial, too. This mission rewards your patriotic restoration of war damaged memorials with cash, so repair each monument you come across (Smithsonian Museum and Castle, Lincoln and Jefferson Memorials, and the Washington Monument).

Concentrate on building Rocketeers and Grizzlies at first, with some GIs thrown in to replace those on the frontlines defending your base. When you have a good sized Rocketeer force (ten or more), move them across the river to the east of the northern bridge where you will find a small Soviet base. Concentrate on destroying the Soviet forces first, and try to get some Engineers into the base to capture some of the buildings there. Once you've eliminated the the threat of this base, move some GIs in and deploy them in the area. A lot of the assaults on your base move through here first, so you'll be able to eliminate the threat before it even gets to your base.

Now you are ready to advance to the Washington Monument with your Rocketeers and Grizzlies. Use the Rocketeers to take out garrisoned structures and the Conscripts within and quickly move the Grizzlies in to eliminate any Flak Tracks which come by. Make sure that you keep producing units back at your base and sending them up to the frontlines.

Once past the Memorial, use your Rocketeers to take out everything that comes their way, with the Grizzlies continuing to watch for anti air units and defenses. When you near the beacon, have your Grizzlies approach it from the southeast and eliminate the Flak Cannon stationed there. You can then move your Rocketeers in from the southeast and eliminate the beacon. With the beacon destroyed, you will win the mission.

<p align="justify">您将以许多GI，一些工程师和MCV开始这项任务。立即部署您的MCV，并按顺序创建一个矿石精炼厂，一个发电厂，一个营房，一个战争工厂和一个空军司令部。在创建这些结构时，将您带到GI并驻守基地外的建筑物。集中精力在河边东侧的建筑物上，因为大多数袭击行动都是通过通向您基地的桥梁进行的。使用您的工程师来修复严重受损的建筑物，以便您的GI可以继续获得其保护的好处。也请一位工程师修理杰斐逊纪念堂。该任务将奖励您现金损坏的爱国主义战争纪念馆，因此修复您遇到的每座纪念碑（史密森尼博物馆和城堡，林肯和杰斐逊纪念堂以及华盛顿纪念碑）。首先要专注于建造火箭队和灰熊队，并使用一些GI来代替一线捍卫基地的GI。当您有一支规模庞大的火箭兵部队（十支或以上）时，将它们越过河移动到北桥的东边，在那里您会发现一个小的苏联基地。首先要集中力量消灭苏联军队，并设法使一些工程师进入基地，以占领那里的一些建筑物。消除了该基地的威胁后，请移入一些GI，然后将其部署在该地区。基地上的许多攻击都首先通过这里进行，因此您可以在威胁到达基地之前消除威胁。现在，您准备好与火箭队和灰熊队一起前往华盛顿纪念碑。使用火箭兵将驻军结构和应征者带走，并迅速将灰熊赶进来，消除掉由此产生的高射炮痕迹。确保将生产单位放回自己的基地，并将其发送到前线。越过纪念馆后，请使用您的火箭兵将所有进来的东西清除掉，而灰熊队将继续监视防空部队和防御工事。当您靠近信标时，让您的灰熊从东南方向接近它，并消除驻扎在那里的高射炮。然后，您可以从东南移动火箭弹，并消除灯塔。灯塔被摧毁后，您将赢得任务。</p>

<p align="justify">After all crucial military and civilian personnel were evacuated from Washington, D.C. to Canada (including General Carville and President Michael Dugan), critical intel came in - General Vladimir just hit the city of Chicago, Illinois hard. In order to retake the city, an amphibious assault over Lake Michigan was suggested, using forces from Canada. It was odd though that the Soviets would strike at Chicago and the American High Command wanted to find out why.

The real reason for the immense Soviet presence was the Psychic Amplifier, a massive structure devised by Yuri to act as a beacon on a country-wide scale. Destroying this structure became a top priority when this was discovered by the American forces. They were not going to lose their homeland to Yuri and Romanov's psionic weapons, no matter what happened.</p>

<p align="justify">在所有重要的军事和文职人员从华盛顿特区撤离到加拿大（包括卡维尔将军和迈克尔·杜根总统）后，重要情报传来了-弗拉基米尔将军刚刚重击伊利诺伊州芝加哥市。 为了夺回这座城市，有人建议使用来自加拿大的部队对密歇根湖进行两栖攻击。 苏联人将在芝加哥发动袭击，而美国高级司令部却想找出原因，这很奇怪。 苏维埃庞大的存在的真正原因是心理放大器，这是尤里（Yuri）设计的庞大结构，可在全国范围内充当灯塔。 当美军发现这种结构时，将其作为头等大事。 无论发生什么事，他们都不会因为尤里和罗曼诺夫的灵能武器而失去家园。</p>

<h3 style="font-weight: bold;">Guide</h3>
<p align="justify">This mission opens with you in command of a force consisting of Destroyers, Transports, and Rocketeers. You will need to immediately select the Rocketeers and have them destroy the Grand Cannons guarding the entrance to the harbor. Once these have been cleared out, send in your destroyers. You'll run into a few Submarines in the harbor, so target these first as they are the greatest threat to your Destroyers. Concentrate the firepower of the Destroyers on a single Submarine and take them out one by one. Next use the Destroyers to eliminate the Flack Tracks on the shoreline.

With the Flack Tracks gone, you can now bring in your Rocketeers. Use them and the Destroyers to take out all of the Soviet units and structures near the shoreline. Once you have secured the immediate beach area, bring in your transports and unload them on the shore.

Deploy the MCV as quickly as possible and get the Construction Yard working on a Power Plant, Refinery, Barracks, and War Factory. Use the GIs to clear out the remaining forces in the base area. The Grizzlies should move to the surrounding streets and concentrate on eliminating the V3s and Flack Tracks in the area. Use your Rocketeers to provide back-up for your tanks, but keep them away from anti-air units at all costs.

The fighting may be bloody at first, so make sure that your base is producing a steady stream of GIs and Grizzlies.

Before too long, you will receive reinforcements - first in the form of more troop-filled Transports and then later as more Rocketeers. Unload the Transports and use the troops to bolster up your army. Bring the Rocketeers in to join up with your current Rocketeer force.

You are now ready for the final push. Use your Rocketeers to clear out the garrisoned buildings to the northeast of your base, protecting them from Flack Tracks with your Grizzlies. Next take them past the amplifier an hit the Flack Cannon stationed to its east. Your Rocketeers are now free to move in and take out the amplifier.

There are other features on the map such as an airbase which can be captured with an Engineer and the Sears Tower which when garrisoned will reveal the entire map. However, it's not worth it to bother with these things. Using the strategy I outlined above, I was able to win this mission in less than half of the par time.

<p align="justify">该任务由您控制，由驱逐舰，运输舰和火箭兵组成。您需要立即选择火箭队，并让它们摧毁守卫海港入口的大炮。这些问题清除之后，请派遣您的驱逐舰。您会在海港碰到几艘潜艇，因此首先要瞄准这些潜艇，因为它们是对您的驱逐舰的最大威胁。将驱逐舰的火力集中在一艘潜水艇上，并将它们逐一取出。接下来，使用驱逐舰消除海岸线上的跳线。随着Flack Tracks的消失，您现在可以携带Rocketeers。利用它们和驱逐舰将苏维埃附近的所有苏联单位和构筑物撤出。一旦确定了紧邻的海滩区域，请携带运输工具并在岸上卸下它们。尽快部署MCV，并使建设场在发电厂，炼油厂，军营和战争工厂工作。使用GI清除基地区域中的剩余力量。灰熊队应该搬到周围的街道，集中精力消除该地区的V3和Flack赛道。使用您的Rocketeers为您的坦克提供后备，但要不惜一切代价使它们远离防空单位。战斗一开始可能是血腥的，所以请确保您的基地正在产生源源不断的GI和灰熊。不久之后，您将获得增援-首先是以更多的部队运输形式，然后是更多的火箭兵。卸载运输工具，并使用军队来加强您的军队。带上火箭兵加入您当前的火箭兵部队。现在您可以进行最后的推送了。使用您的Rocketeers清理基地东北部的守备建筑，保护它们免受灰熊的Flack Tracks袭击。接下来，带他们经过放大器，击中驻扎在其东部的Flack Cannon。现在，您的Rocketeer可以自由进出放大器。地图上还有其他功能，例如可以由工程师捕获的空军基地和驻扎在其上的西尔斯大厦将揭示整个地图。但是，不值得花这些精力去做。使用上面概述的策略，我能够在不到标准杆时间内完成这项任务。</p>

<p align="justify">The destruction of Chicago had a severe impact on the course of the war. For the Soviets, it was a major setback in their plans to conquer America, but expressed little remorse for destroying a major American city home to millions of people. The United States was demoralized by the loss of Chicago, and the US Army suffered massive losses during the explosion.

Fortunately, the nuclear attack on Chicago would hold severe consequences for the Soviet war machine. The Europeans agreed to supply the Americans reinforcements and additional supplies if they agreed to do them a favor: the destruction of the Soviet Nuclear Missile Silos in communist Poland.

If they attempted to aid the Americans in any manner, they risked the nuclear destruction of their cities at the hands of the enemy, and refused to lend any direct support until this threat was neutralized. The American President agreed to these terms, but dispatched the Commander and Special Agent Tanya to Poland to deal with the Soviets. It was here that Tanya began to show some level of respect and trust towards the Commander who had led them this far in the war against the Soviets back home.</p>

<p align="justify">芝加哥的毁坏对战争进程造成了严重影响。对于苏联人来说，这是他们征服美国计划的重大挫折，但他们对摧毁一座拥有数百万人的美国主要城市表示expressed悔。芝加哥的损失使美国士气低落，而美国军在爆炸中损失惨重。幸运的是，对芝加哥的核袭击将对苏联战争机器造成严重后果。欧洲人同意向美国人提供增援和其他补给，如果他们同意帮忙的话：在共产主义波兰销毁苏联核导弹发射井。如果他们试图以任何方式帮助美国人，他们就有遭受敌人摧毁其城市的危险，并拒绝提供任何直接支持，直到这种威胁被消除。美国总统同意这些条款，但派遣了指挥官和特工坦尼亚到波兰与苏联打交道。坦尼亚（Tanya）在这里开始表现出对指挥官的某种程度的尊重和信任，而指挥官在与苏维埃回家的战争中将他们带到了如此遥远的地步。</p>

<h3 style="font-weight: bold;">Guide</h3>
<p align="justify">This is more of an espionage and stealth mission. Begin by moving Tanya to the north and leaving your spies where they are. Pay close attention and as soon as you see an Attack Dog target it immediately. They can take out Tanya quickly and end your mission instantly. After taking out the first Soviet patrol, head to the northwest and detonate the oil barrels there. This will result in a 'bovine rescue' and give you control of three cows. Use these cows as scouts - send them ahead of you to alert you to patrols and Soviet installations.

Keep following the road and soon Tanya will come across a Soviet base. Keep her back and out of range of the Tesla coils as you bring your spies forward to join her. Select a spy and then left click on a Conscript to disguise the spy. Walk him into the base and capture a Tesla Reactor to shut down the base's power - there will only be a pair of dogs that will pose a threat to your spy, but they circle the Battle Lab in a pretty regular pattern and can be easily avoided. When the power is down, have Tanya destroy the two coils near the base entrance. She will then be free to wreck a little havoc in the base - watch for the Tesla Coils at the northeast exit form the base, though. Bring another of your spies into the Battle Lab to complete your first objective.

Now bring your last spy into the base and have him enter a Tesla Reactor to shut down power again. When the power is down, Tanya can get close enough to the coils to shoot the oil barrels surrounding them. You will receive additional spies at this point. Bring them up from the landing zone to join Tanya.

Follow the road north - remember to use your cows to scout ahead and to have Tanya target dogs as soon as they appear. Move Tanya across the bridge and then along the base's west wall. You will find some barrels there that can be destroyed to blow a hole in the base's wall. Enter the base and target the Conscripts and Attack Dogs within the base. There will also be some more barrels to help you knock out the wall around the nuke. Have Tanya destroy the nuke then take her out of the base the way she came in.

Bring your remaining spies up to join Tanya and then proceed along the river to the west. Climb up the hill to the last base's west wall and send a spy through the entrance into a Tesla Reactor. When the power goes down, Tanya can make a break for the final nuke and take it out to win the mission.

<p align="justify">这更多是间谍和隐形任务。首先将Tanya移到北方，然后将间谍留在原地。请密切注意，一旦看到攻击犬立即将其瞄准。他们可以迅速撤出Tanya，并立即结束您的任务。在进行了第一次苏联巡逻之后，前往西北并引爆那里的石油桶。这将导致“牛救助”并让您控制三头母牛。将这些牛用作侦察兵-将它们放到您前面，以提醒您进行巡逻和苏维埃装置。继续走这条路，很快，Tanya会遇到一个苏联基地。当您使间谍前进并加入她时，请不要让她往后走，也不要进入特斯拉线圈的范围。选择一个间谍，然后左键单击一个Conscript来伪装间谍。将他带入基地并捕获特斯拉反应堆以关闭基地的力量-只会有两只狗对您的间谍构成威胁，但它们会以很规则的方式绕过战斗实验室，很容易避免。当电源关闭时，让Tanya摧毁基站入口附近的两个线圈。然后，她将可以随意破坏基地的一小部分-不过，请注意基地底部东北出口的Tesla Coils。将您的另一名间谍带入战斗实验室以完成您的第一个目标。现在将您的最后一个间谍带入基地，让他进入特斯拉反应堆以再次关闭电源。当电源关闭时，Tanya可以距离线圈足够近，以射出围绕它们的油桶。此时您将收到其他间谍。将他们带离登陆区并加入Tanya。沿着北边的路走-记住要用牛向前侦察，并在它们出现后尽快让Tanya瞄准。将Tanya穿过桥，然后沿基地的西墙移动。您会发现那里的一些枪管可以毁坏，在基座壁上打一个洞。输入基地并以基地内的应征者和攻击犬为目标。还有更多的枪管可以帮助您击破核武器周围的墙。让Tanya摧毁核武器，然后按照她进入的方式将其从基地中带出。将您剩下的间谍带入Tanya，然后沿着河向西行驶。爬山到最后一个基地的西墙，并通过入口进入特斯拉反应堆的间谍。断电后，Tanya可以为最后的核弹休息一下，将其拿出来赢得任务。</p>

<p align="justify">With the success of Dark Night in Eastern Europe, the Soviet Union's nuclear threat against Western Europe was neutralized, allowing the European Union to enter the war against the Soviets. Apart from troops and supplies, the German Chancellor granted the Americans permission to utilize the talents of Germany's most brilliant scientist - Albert Einstein. With his new technologies (prism technology in particular), the U.S. was able to strengthen its foothold in those parts of the country it still controlled, forcing the Soviets to back off as their forces were now being countered by newly reinforced and supplied American forces.

The Americans began their campaign to retake America with an amphibious landing on the Arlington side of the Potomac River, intending to establish a base of operations at the Pentagon. By this point, the Soviet Union had heavily fortified Washington, D.C., and had fortified almost every major landmark in the city for their own purposes. In addition to this, the occupation dealt devastating damage to the city's infrastructure, with much of the city leveled and its landmarks desecrated.

The Soviets went so far as to install Stalin's head on the statue of Honest Abe at the Lincoln Memorial, a clear insult to the American people. This did nothing more than enrage the Americans even further, making their counter attack all the more telling as they had every intention of kicking the Soviets out of their nation's capital, forever.</p>


<p align="justify">随着东欧“黑夜”的成功，苏联对西欧的核威胁已被消除，从而使欧盟可以进入对苏维埃的战争。除部队和补给物外，德国总理还授予美国人利用德国最杰出的科学家爱因斯坦（Albert Einstein）的才能的权力。凭借他的新技术（尤其是棱镜技术），美国得以在其仍控制的该国部分地区站稳脚跟，迫使苏联退缩，因为现在他们的部队被新近增援的美军抵抗。美国人开始了他们的运动，企图在波托马克河的阿灵顿侧两栖登陆，从而在五角大楼建立行动基地。至此，苏联已经为华盛顿特区进行了严重的设防，并为自己的目的而设防了这座城市的几乎所有主要地标。除此之外，占领对该城市的基础设施造成了毁灭性的破坏，大部分城市被夷为平地，其地标被亵渎。苏联人甚至把斯大林的头顶在林肯纪念堂的安倍诚实雕像上，这是对美国人民的明显侮辱。这无非是进一步激怒了美国人，使他们的反击更加有力，因为他们有永远把苏联人踢出自己国家首都的打算。</p>

<p align="justify">This mission is a hard-fought one and will take a bit of time to play through. It opens with the Pentagon under heavy attack, but luckily it is also heavily defended. Immediately lead your transports to the base surrounding the Pentagon, unload their troops, and send the troops into the fray. Make sure that you repair damaged defensive structures before they are destroyed.

After fending off the initial assault, pull back your troops under the protection of the Prism Towers. It is best to keep them under protection on your base's eastern flank while you build up an offensive force, otherwise you will expend a lot of resources replacing your losses. The only time you should venture forth is when you are being hit by V3s. Send a couple of Grizzlies out to dispatch them and then withdraw back to the base again.

To protect your base's west flank, garrison the nearby buildings with GIs. Keep a few Engineers handy to repair the buildings if they get too damaged.

While all of this is going on, deploy your MCV and immediately build a Refinery, Barracks, War Factory, and an Air Force Command. After that, concentrate on defensive structures. Add more Prism Towers, Pillboxes, and Patriots.

Concentrate on building GIs and Grizzlies at first. Send some of the GIs out to garrison the buildings near the bridges to the southeast of your base. Continue to keep your other units protected as you build up a sizable force.

Build a few IFVs to use to cross the bridges and scout out the Soviet positions. It also helps at this time to build another Air Force Command or two. When your IFVs uncover Soviet structures, send your Harriers in en masse to take them out. You'll soon find a small base just across the river from yours. When you've weakened it significantly with your Harriers, send in your Grizzlies and GIs to mop it up.

Next build up a force of Rocketeers. Use them to scout ahead of your forces as you move towards the other Soviet base to the northeast. You will encounter numerous garrisoned buildings along the way and the Rocketeers will be able to clean them out for you. When you reach the base, send your Grizzlies to the north and then bring them to the wall at the northern corner of the base. Have them blast through the wall and take out the Soviet Construction Yard and then the Flak Cannons at the back of the base. You can now take out the remaining structures with your Rocketeers and end the mission.

<p align="justify">这项任务是一项艰巨的任务，需要一些时间才能完成。五角大楼在遭受重创的情况下开启了大门，但幸运的是，它也受到了严密的防御。立即将您的运输工具带到五角大楼周围的基地，卸下他们的部队，然后将部队送入战场。确保在损坏的防御结构被破坏之前对其进行修复。在抵御最初的攻击后，在棱镜塔的保护下撤退您的部队。在建立进攻力量时，最好在基地的东部侧翼使它们受到保护，否则，您将花费大量资源来弥补损失。您唯一应该冒险的是被V3击中的时候。派出几只灰熊派遣他们，然后再次撤回基地。为了保护基地的西侧，请使用GI驻守附近的建筑物。如果建筑物太损坏，请让一些工程师方便地进行维修。在进行所有这些操作的同时，部署您的MCV并立即建立精炼厂，兵营，战争工厂和空军司令部。之后，专注于防御结构。添加更多棱镜塔，药盒和爱国者。首先要专注于构建地理标志和灰熊。派出一些GI来驻守基地东南部桥梁附近的建筑物。当您建立一支庞大的部队时，继续保持对其他部队的保护。建造一些IFV，用于过桥并侦察苏联的阵地。这也有助于此时再建立一两个空军司令部。当您的IFV发现苏维埃结构时，请整批派遣您的Har架将其撤出。您很快就会在与您隔河相望的地方找到一个小基地。当您使用Har子将其大大削弱时，请发送灰熊和GI进行清理。接下来建立一支火箭队。当您向东北的另一个苏维埃基地移动时，使用它们在您的部队之前侦察。您将在途中遇到众多驻军建筑，而火箭队将能够为您清理它们。当您到达基地时，将灰熊送到北方，然后将它们带到基地北角的墙上。让它们爆炸穿过墙壁，然后撤出苏联建筑工场，然后撤出基地后面的高射炮。现在，您可以与火箭兵一起拆除剩余的结构并结束任务。</p>

<p align="justify">As the American military and civilian leadership return to Washington, DC from Canada, the Soviet Union was becoming increasingly desperate as they were losing their gains in the American homeland and were now facing attacks from the European Allies. In order to safeguard their presence in the Pacific, they decided to attack and secure the American naval base at Pearl Harbor, apparently trying to replicate the Japanese success of the Pacific War from the original WWII. This time American intelligence knew of this beforehand and set up outposts across the islands to defend against the invasion and dispatched their best commander to lead the defense.

The invasion did not take the Americans by surprise due to their intel beating the Soviets to the punch, but proved overwhelming to the Niihau outpost, which was leveled by Dreadnoughts and used as a staging point for the attack on Oahu, followed by a direct strike against the Pearl Harbor naval base. The loss of the outpost served to warn the Americans of the scope of the invasion and thus, they prepared for the assault and also began to build their navy to counter the Soviets, namely with their Aegis Cruisers to fight the Dreadnoughts' missiles and their Aircraft Carriers to pound the Soviets in retaliation.</p>


<p align="justify">随着美国军事和平民领导层从加拿大返回华盛顿特区，苏联变得越来越绝望，因为他们失去了在美国祖国的利益，现在正面临欧洲盟军的袭击。为了捍卫他们在太平洋的存在，他们决定进攻并确保位于珍珠港的美国海军基地，显然是在从最初的第二次世界大战中复制日本在太平洋战争中的成功。这次，美国情报人员事先知道了这一点，并在各岛上设立了哨所来防御入侵，并派出了他们最好的指挥官来领导防御。入侵并没有使美国人感到惊讶，因为他们的情报击败了苏联人一拳，但事实证明，压倒性地压倒了尼豪（Niihau）哨所，该哨所被无畏舰夷为平地，被用作进攻瓦胡岛的切入点，然后进行了直接打击反对珍珠港海军基地。失去前哨站警告了美国人入侵的范围，因此，他们准备进攻，并开始建立海军以对抗苏维埃人，即与他们的“宙斯盾”巡洋舰对付无畏舰的导弹和飞机航母对苏军进行了报复。</p>

<h3 style="font-weight: bold;">Guide</h3>
<p align="justify">

This is another mission that will place you under heavy assault early on. Fear not, though, because using the following strategy I was able to finish the mission almost a half hour under par. First of all, don't worry about the base on the island in the west. You can't control it and have no hope of defending it.

Be sure to immediately move all of your Destroyer to the front of the harbor. Place your Cruisers behind them and your Carriers behind the Cruisers. You'll then be ready for the naval assault which will soon hit you. In the mean time, build a transport and then queue up a lot of Destroyers.

Also, begin building a lot of GIs. Have them first garrison the buildings just north of your base. Then send a bunch of them over to the buildings on the eastern side of the harbor - the Soviets love to drop Paratroopers there. Also, leave a few GIs deployed in the middle of your base to handle any Paratroopers or Engineers that the Soviets will try to drop on your base.

When the large naval assault comes, direct your Destroyers to take out the Submarines first. Use the Grizzlies that started in your base to harass the ships that come close to shore. When the sub threat has subsided, hit the Scorpions with your Destroyers and direct your Carriers to destroy the Dreadnoughts.

When this threat has been met, load your Transport with an Engineer and a group of GIs. Send it to the island at the top of the map. Deploy your GIs to the buildings there and use your Engineer to take control of the airfield. You will soon gain the benefit of Paratroopers. When available, use them to bolster your defenses around the island.

By this time you should have a sizable fleet of Destroyers, send them out towards the west with the Carriers and Cruisers as backup. Switch your Barracks production to Rocketeers.

About halfway to the Soviet base, you will probably meet some Submarine opposition - hit them hard with your destroyer and keep sailing on.

By this time the Soviets will most likely will have started a nuclear countdown. You'll probably have to eat the first nuke, but can get to him before a second is launched. The two most likely targets are your Refinery and Naval Yard, so when the missile is close to launch, clear you units away from these structures.

When you reach the island, you will find more naval units. Take care of them first and then direct your Destroyers to destroy every anti-air weapon you can see on the east end of the island. When you've done that, move along the island's north coast and keep hitting the anti-aircraft assets. When cleared, move your Destroyers to the south coast to clean up any remaining naval units and to destroy the Naval Yard there.

When the Destroyers have completed their sweep of the anti-air units, target the Nuclear Silo with Rocketeers and your Carriers. The Soviets will still have a lot of anti-air protection so it will be bloody, but you will end the nuclear threat for good.

Now you can begin the slow process of clearing out the Soviet base with your naval units. Concentrate on the Construction Yard at the east end first and work your way west. Before you know it, you'll win the mission.

</p>


<p align="justify">这是另一个任务，它将使您尽早遭受严重攻击。不过，不要害怕，因为使用以下策略，我能够在标准杆下近半小时完成任务。首先，不要担心西部岛屿上的基地。您无法控制它，也没有希望捍卫它。确保立即将所有“驱逐舰”移到港口的前面。将巡洋舰放在它们的后面，将承运人放在巡洋舰的后面。然后，您将为即将袭击您的海战做好准备。同时，建立运输工具，然后将许多驱逐舰排入队列。另外，开始构建大量的GI。让他们首先驻扎在基地北边的建筑物。然后将其中一堆送至海港东侧的建筑物中-苏联人喜欢将伞兵降落在那里。另外，在基地中间部署一些GI，以处理苏联人会试图落在基地上的任何伞兵或工程师。当大型海军突击部队来袭时，请指示您的驱逐舰先将潜艇取出。使用从您的基地开始的灰熊骚扰靠近海岸的船只。当次要威胁平息后，用驱逐舰击中蝎子，并指示承运人消灭无畏舰。遇到此威胁后，请向您的运输设备加载工程师和一组GI。将其发送到地图顶部的岛屿。将GI部署到那里的建筑物，并使用您的工程师来控制飞机场。您很快就会获得伞兵的好处。如果可以的话，用它们来增强岛上的防御力。到此时，您应该拥有相当数量的驱逐舰，将它们驱逐到西部，并配备运输舰和巡洋舰作为后盾。将您的军营生产切换到火箭队。大约在苏联基地的一半处，您可能会遇到一些潜水艇的反对派-用驱逐舰重击他们并继续航行。到这个时候，苏联很可能将开始核倒计时。您可能必须吃掉第一个核弹，但可以在第二个发射之前找到他。两个最可能的目标是您的精炼厂和海军院，因此，当导弹接近发射时，将您的单位疏离这些结构。当您到达岛屿时，您会发现更多的海军单位。首先要照顾好他们，然后指挥驱逐舰销毁您可以在岛东端看到的所有防空武器。完成此操作后，沿着岛屿的北海岸行驶，继续击中防空资产。清除后，将“驱逐舰”移到南海岸，以清理所有剩余的海军单位并摧毁那里的海军院。驱逐舰完成防空单位的扫荡后，将火箭筒和您的航母对准核发射井。苏联仍将有很多防空措施，因此将是血腥的，但您将永远结束核威胁。现在，您可以开始用缓慢的步伐清理您的海军部队的苏联基地。首先集中在东端的建设场，然后向西行驶。在不知不觉中，您将赢得任务。</p>

<p align="justify">With the defense of Pearl Harbor successful, the American military finally held a firm grip on the Pacific. The Allied commander responsible for the successful defence was even looking forward to some R&R at Hawaii, but the Soviet Union soon came up with another plan altogether.

St. Louis, the heart of ground control for the Missouri state, came under psychic control of the Soviets, from a psychic beacon deployed by Yuri's adepts in the bombed out Busch Stadium. Reluctantly, President Michael Dugan ordered an attack on the city, permitting the commander to open fire on American citizens if it's necessary for the destruction of the threat. Agent Tanya was to lead the attack, racing against time as the psychic influence bore through her training and mental resistance.

The city itself was under full control - all American soldiers and citizens were obedient Soviet slaves. This made the mission hard for the American strike team as they were facing the same situation as before in Washington when forced to kill their fellow Americans who were used as cannon fodder by the Soviets. This made them also all the more eager to finally fight the Soviets and make them pay for their invasion.

<p align="justify">在成功防御珍珠港之后，美军终于在太平洋上牢牢控制了自己。负责成功防御的盟军连长甚至都希望在夏威夷进行一些R＆R，但苏联很快就提出了另一项计划。圣路易斯是密苏里州地面控制的心脏，它由尤里的专家部署在被炸毁的布希体育场内的心理信标，受到苏维埃人的心理控制。迈克尔·杜根（Michael Dugan）总统无奈下令对这座城市发动进攻，允许指挥官在摧毁威胁的必要情况下向美国公民开火。特妮娅（Tanya）特工领导这次袭击，与时间赛跑，因为她的训练和精神抵抗导致了心理影响。这个城市本身处于完全控制之下-所有美国士兵和公民都是服从的苏联奴隶。这给美国打击队造成了艰巨的任务，因为他们面临与华盛顿以前相同的局势，当时他们被迫杀死被苏联人用作炮灰的美国同胞。这也使他们更加渴望最终与苏军作战，并让他们为入侵付出代价。</p>

<p align="justify">
This is a two-phased mission - the first is stealth and espionage and the second is a base to base battle to the death. So, ready to complete this mission in under half of par time? Select Tanya and have her head a short way to the north. There will be a Soviet patrol heading your way with a couple of Attack Dogs and you'll want to have Tanya take the dogs out pronto.

Next head towards the elevated highway just to the southwest of your starting position. There will be an Attack Dog nearby, so make sure Tanya is ready to shoot it.

Proceed along the highway, using Tanya to target passing patrols, especially any Attack Dogs. Also be ready for troops ahead of and sneaking up behind you on the highway. If tanks or IFVs pass on the streets below you, immediately deploy your GIs and they will eliminate the armor without taking much damage.

When you reach the end of the highway, send your GIs into a nearby building. Have Tanya move slowly to the northwest towards the base's entrance. There will be patrols in the area, so make sure you concentrate on eliminating local ground forces first. Shoot the oil barrels at the base's northeast corner to eliminate a couple Tesla Coils and some Soviet troopers. Be careful of any War Miners in the resource field to the north of the base - they'll make short work of Tonya and end your mission. Next, destroy the Tesla Reactors to power down the base. Now bring one of your engineers up to capture the psychic beacon.

With this done, reinforcements will arrive at the St. Louis Arch. Move all of the troops out in front of the Arch and deploy your MCV behind it. Immediately build a Refinery, a Barracks, and a War Factory.

Meanwhile, use Tanya to destroy the the remnants of the base around Busch Stadium. Hit the reactors first - if you don't you might eliminate some of the power drain on the base, bringing the remaining Tesla Coils online and frying Tonya. Once the stadium is cleared, take Tanya and the GIs back towards your base. Have Tanya stop on the highway just west of your base. Whenever Desolators approach, have her pick them off long before they get near your base.

Concentrate on building GIs, Grizzlies, and base defenses. Keep your Prism Tanks in your second rank - they'll do a great job of helping to defend your base, but are too fragile to risk offensively in this mission.

When you have about ten GI's, send them under the highway and garrison the first building there. Keep building GIs and garrisoning more buildings near the Soviet base. Keep a couple of Engineers in reserve, though, to repair buildings that have taken too much damage.

Once you have a fairly stable foothold in the buildings, take your Grizzlies north along the far east edge of the map. Bring them down on the Soviet base's northeast wall and punch a hole through it. Start taking out the Tesla Reactors there and then move on to the other structures. Send GIs through the broken wall and deploy them within range of a structure or two. When they have destroyed those structures, move them forward a bit and then re-deploy them. Between the GIs and Grizzlies, you'll soon wipe out the Soviet base. When the end is near, the Soviets will sell all of their remaining buildings and make one last mad rush at your forces. You should easily wipe them out though and win the mission.

<p align="justify">这是一个分为两个阶段的任务-第一个是隐身和间谍活动，第二个是打死战的基础。那么，准备好在少于标准时间的一半时间内完成此任务了吗？选择“ Tanya”，然后向北走近。会有一对苏联巡逻队带着几只攻击犬驶向您的方向，您将希望Tanya将这些狗带出门。接下来前往您起始位置西南方的高架公路。附近会有攻击犬，因此请确保Tanya准备射击它。沿着高速公路前进，使用Tanya瞄准通过的巡逻队，尤其是任何攻击犬。也要为前方的部队做好准备，并在高速公路上向你身后偷袭。如果坦克或IFV在您下方的街道上通过，请立即部署您的GI，它们将消灭装甲而不造成太大伤害。当您到达高速公路的尽头时，将您的地理标志发送到附近的建筑物中。让Tanya缓慢地向西北方向移动至基地入口。该地区将进行巡逻，因此请确保您首先专注于消除当地地面部队。在基地东北角射出石油桶，以消灭一对特斯拉线圈和一些苏联士兵。小心基地北部资源领域中的任何战工-他们将简化托尼亚的工作，并结束您的任务。接下来，摧毁特斯拉反应堆以关闭基地。现在，请您的一名工程师来捕获心理信标。完成后，援军将到达圣路易斯拱门。将所有部队移出拱门，然后将MCV部署在拱门后。立即建立精炼厂，兵营和战争工厂。同时，使用Tanya摧毁布希体育场附近基地的残余物。首先击中反应堆-如果不这样做，您可能会消除底座上的一些功率消耗，将其余的Tesla Coils联机并炸炸Tonya。清理完体育场后，将Tanya和GI带回到您的基地。让Tanya在您基地西边的高速公路上停下来。每当荒凉者靠近时，请她在距离您的基地很近之前将它们摘下。专注于构建GI，灰熊和基地防御。将您的Prism Tanks保持在第二位-他们将在保护您的基地方面做得很好，但是太脆弱了，无法在此任务中冒犯规。当您有大约十个地理标志时，将它们发送到高速公路下，并驻扎在那里的第一座建筑物。继续在苏联基地附近建造地理标志并驻守更多建筑物。不过，请保留一些工程师，以修复遭受太大破坏的建筑物。一旦您在建筑物中站稳了脚跟，请沿着地图的远东边缘将您的灰熊朝北。将它们放到苏联基地的东北墙上，并在上面打个洞。从那里开始取出特斯拉反应堆，然后再转移到其他结构。通过破碎的墙壁发送地理标志，并将其部署在一个或两个结构的范围内。当它们摧毁了这些建筑物后，将它们向前移动一点，然后重新部署它们。在地理标志和灰熊之间，您将很快消灭苏联基地。当尽头时，苏联人将出售所有剩余的建筑物，并向您的部队发狂。您应该轻松消灭它们并赢得任务。</p>

<p align="justify">While the popular opinion was that the Allies have the upper hand in their battle against the Soviet Union (in particular the WarWatch programme), the war was far from over. The Reds still had strength and cunning, enough to tip the scales. The Soviets managed to capture one of the Allies' west coast bases, and a Prism Tower with it. In order to mitigate the increasing Allied usage of Prism technology, they attempted to replicate it, establishing a research base in the ruined Mayan city of Tulum, Mexico in the Yucatan Peninsula.

In order to prevent them from reverse-engineering this technology, the Allies deployed a SEAL strike team to the location, to cut short any attempts to replicate the biggest advantage, the Allied war machine ever had. They were also informed that there could be resistance forces there to aid them in the battle. These forces would be bolstered by other units coming in, and if possible, turn the Soviets' latest attempt of making Prism technology against them.

You open this mission with a squad of Navy Seals which are air dropped into Mexico. Move your Seals along the shoreline to the west until you reach a squad of Soviet troops and Attack Dogs. Eliminate them making sure to take out the dogs first.

Now follow the tire tracks north up onto the hill. You'll find several groups of Conscripts and a few Attack Dogs guarding pens filled with GIs, Engineers, and a couple of Grizzlies. When the Soviet troops have been eliminated, the penned-up troops will join your cause and you'll gain the use of a NightHawk as well. Move the GIs into the huts just to the west of the pens and place your Grizzlies next to the huts. Place one Engineer in the NightHawk and transport him the northwest corner of the map. You'll find an airstrip here to capture and provide you with periodic reinforcements for the rest of the mission. Now fly your NightHawk back to your troops and then south to the north wall of the Soviet compound. Use it to destroy the Sentry Gun you'll find there.

Now send your Seals into the base and clear out any opposition around the Soviet Prism Tower. Use one Engineer to capture the tower and another to take the Tesla Reactor right next to it. The tower will now come on line and take out any Soviet Troops that come near. Now move your Seals slowly into the base shooting any barrels you see and taking out the Soviet structures one by one. Destroy the second Prism Tower instead of capturing it. IF you capture it the power drain will be too high and your towers will fail to function.

When you have paratrooper reinforcements ready, drop them near your prism tower and deploy them. Once the Seals have taken care of a lot of the opposition, move the GIs into the base and have them help clean up the remaining structures and units. You can also use your NightHawk in the mopping up operations once the Flak Cannons have been destroyed.

Once again, these strategies should help you complete this level in under half of par time.

Their ultimate goal was to kill the acclaimed scientist in an attempt to end his supplement of weapons and technology to the Allies, as it was his alliance with the West that ultimately turned the tide against the Soviet Union.

Additional U.S. forces began deploying to Europe and the Allies perceived victory to be the likelier outcome. General George Carville, along with the Commander, was ordered to Germany to help defend the laboratory. The Germans feared defeat without their strategic skills.

When this mission opens, you must move quickly to ready yourself for the large Soviet onslaught that is soon to come. Order your MCV to deploy on the hill near Einstein's lab. Immediately build a Refinery and create a couple more Chronominers. You'll also want to send an Engineer to the area north of Einstein's lab - there is a derrick there which you can capture to increase your income.

Now concentrate on building your base's defenses. Build a lot of Prism Towers and the Power Plants to keep them going. Also build Rocketeers, GIs, and Grizzlies. Deploy your GIs around your base's perimeter to supplement your Prism tower defenses. When the Soviet onslaught comes, let your Prism Towers do their work and use the Rocketeers and Grizzlies to take out any V3 Launchers that come by.

After the onslaught, you will face only minor attacks, and so can concentrate on building an offensive force. I found that a large force of Prism Tanks do an excellent job of clearing out the Soviet bases in this mission. Also, build a few Grizzlies to help defend the Prism Tanks when things get a little hot.

While creating your offensive force, build the remaining available base structures, including an Ore Purifier, and place them Einstein's lab. Send an Engineer to the southwest to repair the Refinery you'll find there. At this point you should have a very robust economy and will have no troubles creating a large offensive force.

When you have ten or more Prism tanks, send them to the southwest to clear out the first Soviet base. Advance them slowly so that the Soviet forces can not get too close to your fragile tanks. Also, keep back from the Nuclear Reactor when it blows, or some of your units will be affected by the fallout. Proceed to the next two Soviet bases in similar fashion and victory will be yours.

With it, the Allies could literally launch an attack anywhere on the globe they wish by moving any army through time and space. However, Einstein only found one suitable location to build it - the island of Key West in the Florida Keys, "only a few short kilometers" close to Soviet-controlled Cuba.

When the Soviets received this news, they rallied their forces and prepared themselves - if the Chronosphere was successfully deployed, they knew their chances of winning the war after that are slim to none. Premier Romanov knew this as well and ordered the deployment of Nuclear Missile Silos on Cuba to smash the Allied forces to submission and to deal with the Commander who had been a thorn on his and the Soviet Union's side for too long.

<p align="justify">在战争的这一点上，尽管由于疯狂的伊万的自杀式袭击而使卡维尔将军丧命，但美国人还是成功地解放了家园，在盟军的帮助下，他们开始将注意力集中在仍由苏联控制的那些国家上。在黑森林和阿尔伯特·爱因斯坦（Albert Einstein）的实验室被苏联人破坏后试图摧毁它的实验室所保护，同盟的聪明才智向司令官提供了他的秘密武器-时空层。有了它，盟军就可以通过在时空上移动任何一支军队，在他们希望的地球上任何地方发动一次进攻。然而，爱因斯坦只找到了一个合适的位置来建造它-佛罗里达礁岛群的基韦斯特岛，距离苏联控制的古巴仅几公里之遥。当苏联人收到这个消息时，他们集结了部队并做好了准备-如果成功部署了时空圈，那以后他们知道赢得战争的机会微乎其微。罗曼诺夫总理也知道这一点，并下令在古巴部署核导弹发射井，以粉碎盟军服从并与司令长打交道，司令长久以来一直对他和苏联方面都造成了伤害。</p>

Make sure you're nice and comfortable, because this mission will be a long one. Your first order of business is to secure your base from attack. Garrison the lighthouse on your island to the southwest, the hotels east of your base, and the buildings near your Refinery to the northwest with GIs.

Next began producing a few Seals and GIs. Keep the Seals near the beach at your main base's southeast corner. Also produce Destroyers and move some of them to the east of your base. Produce Prism Towers (and the Power Plants to run them) and place a couple near your isolated Refineries to the southwest and northwest.

You will soon be assaulted by Dreadnaughts - take them out quickly with your Seals and Destroyers. After this, you'll mostly face small assaults by foot soldiers that your base defenses should be able to handle. Continue to add base structures and build the Chronosphere as soon as it is available. Begin building a force of Grizzlies.

Build several Destroyers and Dolphins and send them south to Cuba. Engage any naval forces you encounter on the way and then destroy the two Soviet Shipyards. This will relieve your forces from future Soviet naval strikes.

Now build a transport and load it with a Spy and Seals. Take it to the west edge of the map and then south to Cuba. It is a good idea to escort it with Dolphins and Destroyers to prevent its loss in transit. When you reach the shoreline, disguise the spy and send him into the Nuclear Reactor. Next send your Seals due north of the reactor and then order them to destroy it. You'll take some heavy fire from the Sentry Guns, but one Seal should be able to make it through and take out the reactor. Send the Transport back to your base to pick up another couple of Spies and a few Seals.

By now you should be ready to transport using the Chronosphere. Select your Grizzlies and send them behind the Soviet base at the map's southern edge. There are barrels here which they should destroy as quickly as possible to take out more of the Soviet power grid. At this point, the nuclear countdown should halt due to lack of power. If it doesn't send a spy into one of the launchers to reset the countdown and buy yourself more time.

At this point, switch your production to Prism Tanks and continue to ferry Spies and Seals down to the west edge of Cuba. Use the Spies to infiltrate Soviet structures, allowing you to steal money and to begin producing veteran units. Sneak your Seals along the southern edge of the map and try to get them close enough to plant charges on the Nuclear Silos. Also use the Chronosphere to send Prism Tanks at the silos. You are now locked in a war of attrition, but you have the upper hand in resources. Continue to hammer at the south edge of the base with Prism Tanks and Seals until all of the silos have been destroyed and you win the mission.

If you find yourself harassed by Soviet Apocalypse Tanks, then use the Chronosphere to target them and transport them to sea. They'll sink below the waves and bother you no more.

<p align="justify">确保您舒适愉快，因为此任务将是一个漫长的过程。您的首要任务是保护您的基地不受攻击。驻守您西南部岛上的灯塔，基地以东的旅馆以及西北部带有地理标志的炼油厂附近的建筑物。接下来开始生产一些印章和地理标志。将海豹突击队保持在您主要基地东南角的海滩附近。还要生产驱逐舰，并将其中一些驱逐到基地的东部。生产棱镜塔（和运行它们的发电厂），并在您偏僻的炼油厂附近向西南和西北放置一对夫妇。您将很快被无畏舰袭击-用海豹和驱逐舰迅速将它们赶出去。在此之后，您将主要面对步兵的小攻击，您的基础防御应该能够应付。继续添加基础结构，并在可用时立即构建Chronosphere。开始建立一支灰熊部队。建造几艘驱逐舰和海豚，然后将它们驱赶到古巴。与您在途中遇到的任何海军部队交战，然后摧毁这两个苏联造船厂。这将使您的部队免于今后进行的苏联海军打击。现在构建运输工具，并使用间谍和海豹突击队进行装载。将其带到地图的西边缘，然后向南至古巴。最好与海豚和驱逐舰一起护送它，以防止其在运输中丢失。当您到达海岸线时，伪装间谍并将其送入核反应堆。接下来，将您的海豹寄到反应堆北部，然后命令他们摧毁它。您将从哨兵枪上猛烈射击，但一个“海豹”应该能够通过并拿出反应堆。将运输工具送回您的基地，再接再收几个间谍和一些海豹。现在，您应该已经准备好使用Chronosphere进行运输了。选择您的灰熊，并将其发送到地图南端的苏联基地后面。这里有一些桶，他们应该尽快销毁它们，以便从苏联电网中撤出更多。此时，由于动力不足，核倒计时应该停止。如果它没有送间谍进入发射器之一，则可以重置倒计时并为自己购买更多时间。此时，将您的生产切换到Prism Tanks，然后继续将“间谍”和“海豹”运送到古巴西边缘。使用间谍来渗透苏联建筑，让您偷钱并开始生产退伍军人单位。沿着地图的南部边缘潜行您的海豹，并设法使其离得足够近，以便在核发射筒仓上装药。还可以使用Chronosphere在筒仓发送棱镜坦克。您现在陷入了消耗战，但您在资源方面占据上风。继续用Prism Tanks和Seals在基地的南边缘锤击，直到所有筒仓都被摧毁，然后您就赢得了任务。如果您发现自己被苏联启示录坦克骚扰，请使用“时空”瞄准它们并将其运送到海上。它们将沉入海浪之下，不再打扰您。</p>

In order to seal the fate of the USSR, the Allies have to capture Romanov and behead the Soviet war machine. However an invasion of Russia by conventional means will take months to complete and cost massive Allied lives.

The Chronosphere in Florida Keys is the key to victory - a full scale invasion of Moscow will be performed by troops teleported from all over the world into the heart of the city. The teleported troops will consist of IFVs, Grizzly, and Prism tanks, beside the MCV. President Michael Dugan appointed the Allied Commander as General Carville's successor to spearhead the invasion at General Carville's funeral.

The odds are not in favor - the Soviets still outnumber the Allies 10 to 1 and the Kremlin is protected by a fortified city and the hardiest Soviet troops, including Romanov's personal elite unit, the Black Guard.

Of course, the Soviets also have the Iron Curtain at their disposal and are not ashamed to use a tactical nuclear missile on their own soil. To counter the Soviet nuclear threat, Allied scientists created the Weather Control Device, a machine that allows Allied commanders to create fierce lightning storms over enemy positions.

<p align="justify">为了密封苏联的命运，盟军必须占领罗曼诺夫并斩首苏联的战争机器。但是，以常规方式入侵俄罗斯将需要数月才能完成，并造成大量盟军丧生。佛罗里达礁岛礁的时空层是胜利的关键-从世界各地转移到城市心脏的军队将对莫斯科进行全面入侵。传送的部队将由MCV旁边的IFV，灰熊和棱镜坦克组成。迈克尔·杜根总统任命盟军司令为卡维尔将军的继任者，在卡维尔将军的葬礼上率先入侵。可能性不大-苏联仍然比盟军10比1多，而克里姆林宫则由一个设防的城市和包括罗曼诺夫的个人精锐部队黑卫队在内的最坚强的苏军保护。当然，苏联人还拥有铁幕，不为在自己的土地上使用战术核导弹感到羞耻。为了对抗苏联的核威胁，盟军科学家制造了天气控制装置，这是一台允许盟军指挥官在敌人阵地上制造猛烈雷暴的机器。</p>

As soon as this mission opens, use your Seals to clear out the Conscripts near the Tesla Reactor and then destroy it. This will cause reinforcements to be sent in - while they're arriving use the Seals to mop up the remaining Conscripts. Free the troops in the compound in the northeast corner of the area and send the Engineers to capture two of the nearby derricks.

Your first order of business is to get your base up and to do it quickly. You'll need all of the possible structures, but try to spread them out a bit. Your Construction Yard is the primary target of Soviet nukes, so you'll want to minimize collateral damage. Also be sure to build Prism Towers and Patriots for defense.

When you have a Barracks, start creating GIs and Engineers. Use the Engineers to capture the remaining derricks. Garrison the bunkers at your base's gates and as many of the surrounding buildings as you can.

There is an isolated Soviet Refinery to the west of your base. Periodically send a Spy into it to steal money from the Soviets. Also, if you head out of your base's east gate and follow the road to the south you will come to an airfield that you can capture with an Engineer.

When available, build the Spy Satellite Uplink and begin making Chrono Legionnaires. Keep a couple around your base in case of a nuke attack. If a nuke is launched, command your Legionnaires to attack your own buildings. The nuke will hit and destroy the Legionnaires, but your buildings will be saved.

Take a couple of Legionnaires to the southeast part of the map. You'll find two Nuclear Reactors there - target them with the Legionnaires. Now take two pairs of Legionnaires to the reactors at the southern edge of the map. They should be able to destroy the reactors without too much trouble, but if they catch the attention of a tank, immediately target the tank and then get back to the reactors. With the reactors out of the way, the Soviets will be out of power and the nuke strikes will cease.

Now it becomes a simple matter of taking out the Soviet bases. Grizzlies and Prism Tanks in tandem should do the trick. Use your Chronosphere to target enemy armor - including the elite Black Guards - and dump them in the river.

When you've eliminated the defenses around the Kremlin, Tanya shows up to capture Romanov and you'll win the mission ... and the war!

<p align="justify">该任务开始后，立即使用您的印章清除特斯拉反应堆附近的应征者，然后销毁它。这将导致增援部队被派遣进来-当他们到达时，使用海豹擦拭剩余的应征者。释放该地区东北角大院中的部队，并派遣工程师占领附近的两架井架。您的首要业务是建立基础并迅速开展业务。您将需要所有可能的结构，但请尝试将它们散开一点。您的建造场是苏联核武器的主要攻击目标，因此您将希望最大程度地减少附带损害。另外，请务必建造用于防御的“棱镜塔”和“爱国者”。拥有军营后，开始创建GI和工程师。使用工程师捕获剩余的井架。驻守在基地大门口的bun堡以及尽可能多的周围建筑物。您的基地以西有一座孤立的苏联炼油厂。定期派间谍进入其中，以窃取苏维埃的资金。另外，如果您从基地的东门出来，然后沿着向南的路走，您将来到一个可以与工程师一同占领的机场。如果可用，请建立间谍卫星上行链路，然后开始制作Chrono Legionnaires。如果发生核武器袭击，请在您的基地附近保持一对。如果发射了核弹，请命令您的军团士兵进攻您自己的建筑物。核弹将击中并摧毁军团士兵，但您的建筑物将被保存。将几个军团士兵带到地图的东南部。您会在那里找到两个核反应堆-以军团士兵为目标。现在，将两对军团士兵带到地图南端的反应堆。他们应该能够在没有太多麻烦的情况下摧毁反应堆，但是如果它们引起了坦克的注意，请立即瞄准坦克，然后回到反应堆。随着反应堆的畅通，苏维埃将失去权力，核打击将停止。现在，撤离苏联根据地已经很简单了。串联的灰熊和棱镜坦克应该可以解决问题。使用您的时空层来瞄准敌人的装甲-包括精英黑卫兵-并将它们扔到河里。消除克里姆林宫周围的防御设施后，塔尼亚（Tanya）出现并占领罗曼诺夫（Romanov），您将赢得任务...和战争！</p>
