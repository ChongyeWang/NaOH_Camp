        <p style="color: black;" align="justify">During the Third World War, it was not uncommon for civilian aircraft to be commandeered by either army for use of troop transport. Such a delivery would require the capture of a local civilian airport, and a six-to-eight-man infantry squad could periodically be flown in. This was generally seen as a more useful tactic for the Allies, given that their basic infantry, the GI, was better trained and equipped than a Soviet Conscript. Yuri's army imitated the other two sides, having six Initiates deployed at each paradrop. America in particular was known for having ample numbers of patriotic soldiers more than willing to go headfirst into battle. To this end, the United States expanded its Airborne Infantry program and set up a network that sent eight GIs into the battlefield via a civilian transport plane to any location near a commanders base. The commander would need an Airforce Command Headquarter to connect to this network. In addition, the American army could still commandeer civilian aircraft with the regular paradrop method, allowing them to deploy a maximum of fourteen paratroopers at a time.

		This was useful for garrisoning civilian buildings or dropping GIs behind enemy lines, catching enemies off guard. There were a few problems with the system, however. The transport planes used were fairly slow and vulnerable to AA fire; this made dropping infantry over enemy bases or positions with flak cannons or gatling cannons a borderline death sentence for the paratroopers. The troopers also had to be deployed on a scouted area, or they would risk being shot down.</p>

        <p style="color: black;" align="justify">Soviet rush tactics had left French commanders reeling with terror. Sensing that their Pillbox and Turret somewhat were ineffective against rushes, the French quickly revamped their defensive structure. As they felt that the pillbox design had somewhat reached its maturity, they chose to utilize a Turret design instead. The modification included adding an artillery cannon with a very large caliber and reinforcing the armour. Thus, the Grand Cannon was born. Other Allied countries, however, thought this structure was somewhat overwhelming, thus it was not fully adopted by them.

		The Grand cannon is basically a large turret capable of firing very powerful shells to an extreme range. The cannons are effective against both infantry and tanks, and would cause considerable collateral damage in the area around the target. Any lightly armoured unit that was unlucky enough to get within its range of fire could be destroyed in a single shot, which includes some infantry as well. They also do splash damage, so even when playing against an easy enemy in skirmish, a Grand cannon can kill AI basic infantry battalions with three shots at most. Their range is comparable to that of most siege units, and only air units can safely dispatch these gargantuan turrets. A few Grand cannons, presumably French-built, were also found in use in the United States, namely in San Francisco and Chicago. In Chicago, the Cannons guarding the way into the city were acquired by the Soviet forces upon the city's capture and had to be destroyed by the Allies.

		In San Francisco, four cannons guarded the Golden Gate Bridge and San Francisco Bay against the initial Soviet invasion. During the Psychic Dominator Disaster, France authorized their design and knowledge to be shared in an effort against Yuri. Their design somehow spread beyond their intentions as such designs can be obtained by the Soviets via a secret Tech Secret Lab in their final battle in Transylvania. </p>

        <p style="color: black;" align="justify">It has a large anti-tank cannon mounted on a flexible, tracked platform, which is capable of easily destroying enemy tanks, even punching through the heavy armour of Apocalypse tanks and ore miners. However, the tank destroyer was strictly capable of providing anti-armour support, as it was nearly useless against infantry or structures. It was also relatively lightly armoured and unable to attack air units. They can still lose to Apocalypse tanks in one-on-one matches, making them better to use in large groups against vehicles.

It is not known to have operated after the events of the Psychic Dominator Disaster. The UltraAP damage type deals full damage to units with light and heavy armour, less than half damage to medium armour, and barely any to everything else; hence, the tank destroyer's weapon is efficient against vehicles, but not infantry.

The AI usually attacks with 4 tank destroyers. They prioritize enemy vehicles above all other targets, and will completely ignore any building or infantry unit while at least one enemy vehicle exists on the battlefield. If all vehicles are destroyed, tank destroyers become like any other tank, with no preferred target, and will attack the nearest building or infantry unit.

Tank destroyers are one of the possible crate bonuses in skirmish and multiplayer matches.</p>

The sniper was also a master of stealth, being able to kill enemy infantry at long range without revealing his position.

Though no man could survive being in a sniper's sights for long, the round lacked the power to sufficiently damage vehicles or structures. Combined with the sniper rifle's slow rate of fire, the sniper was at a disadvantage in close-ranged firefights.

To increase survivability, snipers could be deployed inside an IFV, enhancing their speed and rate of fire.</p>

        <p style="color: black;" align="justify">Korean aeronautical engineers sought to replace the under-armored Harrier used by the rest of the Allied nations with an indigenous design, emphasizing both survivability and firepower, while maintaining the flexibility of VTOL technology and a high speed. The result was the advanced Black Eagle jet.

According to the render, this plane is an advanced twin-engine VTOL two-seat fighter-bomber designed with forward-swept wing configuration and a characteristic black job, which was used by their crews to distinguish "Korea's Finest" from the other Korean/Allied pilots. Its avionics and weapons systems were state of the art. To increase survivability, heavy armor was incorporated into the plane, providing the level of protection needed for attacks on heavily defended Soviet facilities at a negligible cost of speed. Improved Maverick II missiles, which have a larger explosive, were equipped on these units, making them ideal to attack not only armor and vehicles but structures as well. Because of the forward-swept wings, twin engine design, advanced avionics and heavy armor, the Black Eagle was far more technologically advanced than the Harrier used by the rest of the Allies, but thanks to efficient Korean research, development and production techniques, the jet maintained the same production cost as the Harrier it replaced.

Thanks to its upgraded missiles, the Black Eagle was very effective at destroying armor, as two or even one unit could the destroy most conventional tanks. Its advanced construction and armor makes it able to resist 4-6 Patriot Missiles, compared to the mere 2 missiles required to take a Harrier out of the sky. However, massed triple A positions were a serious threat, making attacks on the heart of an exceptionally well-defended enemy base difficult. Still, Korean commanders could rely on these jets and their crews to attack reasonably defended targets and still survive to return to base, something that the Harrier employed by the rest of the Allied countries could not claim.

It was erased from the timeline after the Soviets meddled with the space-time continuum. Black Eagles are useful in most combat situations except for air-to-air engagements, hence its status as a heavy fighter-bomber. They can attack every target on the ground and eight can take out just about any structures. In Elite status, four will suffice, though losses can be expected. To avoid these losses, some lucky Korean commanders who had captured a Soviet base used the powers of the Iron Curtain to make their Elite jets invulnerable, therefore making them almost unstoppable. They were best known for their role in eliminating Yuri's Cloning Vats in Australia.

Black Eagles in squadrons of four to ten make for excellent harassment and raiding. They can also be used to intercept armour columns before they reach a base or destroy enemy ore miners in seconds. Their survivability is much better than Harriers, and if Elite, a Black Eagle can stand almost the same amount of Patriot missiles as the Paradrop C-130 before falling from the sky (likely 6 missiles).</p>

        <p style="color: black;" align="justify">It uses a fully tracked chassis with two small turret-mounted Tesla coils. The mobile Tesla system has less range and power against vehicles and structures than its stationary counterpart. However the lightning bolts arc over obstacles and easily eliminate infantry.

In the War of the Three Powers, a different version of the tank was created, but was not widely deployed. In the Allied campaigns of both Red Alert 2 and Yuri's Revenge, the Tesla tank was only seen during Operation: Chrono Storm, since the operation took place in Russia's capital Moscow, the tank's main production facility.

In the Soviet campaign of Red Alert 2, it did not make an appearance. The tanks are particularly effective en masse as, although lightly armored, their attack was quite strong and had a very short reload time, meaning it can make short work of most vehicles, especially Grizzly tanks and IFVs. Like other tanks, it can also crush enemy infantry by simply running over them. They however have trouble breaking through prism towers and other heavy defenses, due to the short range of their Tesla weapon.

The Tesla tank is a country specific unit: in order to build it in skirmish, one needs to play as the Russia country. Another method of building the tank lies in capturing a Tech Secret Lab which may give the plans for this tank, allowing it to be constructed even from non-Soviet war factories. In skirmishes, crates may contain this "short circuit on wheels."

Tesla tanks are quite capable of acting as distracting units like Apocalypse tanks; they have less than half of the health as an Apocalypse tank, move faster, cheaper and more effective damage against all ground targets.

The AI usually attack with 3 Tesla tanks and 2 Rhino tanks. They prioritize defensive structures above all other targets, and will bypass all other types of enemy structures and units while any defenses remain on the battlefield. However, once they become aware of enemy units, they will leave their previously targeted building and engage them instead. Once all of the nearby enemy units are defeated, they will proceed to attack the nearest building from their current location. Note that like all tanks that prioritize defenses, Tesla tanks do not consider Tank bunkers to be a defense regardless of whether or not it contains enemy tanks.

Once all defenses are destroyed, Tesla tanks become like any other tank with no preferred target; they will attack the nearest building to them regardless of type, and will turn and attack enemy units if they become aware of any nearby.</p>

        <p style="color: black;" align="justify">These fanatical communists run towards any building or unit owned by the filthy capitalists or the traitor Yuri and detonate the explosives they wear, destroying or heavily damaging the target and killing themselves. Cubans find no shortage of loyal communists willing to die for the cause of global revolution. Therefore, terrorists can be trained and armed at a low cost. On their own, terrorists are essentially a cheaper and weaker version of the Libyan demolition truck. The result is that they have to be massed against a target building for full effect. However, if they are bunched up, as moving masses of infantry usually are, if even one is killed, it will cause a chain reaction of explosions that will take out the whole group. That is not even if a sniper or air strike kills one: by definition, Terrorists explode when they attack a building or killed by enemy fire, as they are equipped with a dead man's switch. If they are sent in a horde of 10-30, single-file, the explosion of the first will cause the rest to self-destruct in a chain of explosions before they even reach their target. Thus, terrorists must be used carefully: if a large swarm of a dozen or so makes it near a building, they must make sure they hit it all at once.

Terrorists are, however, considered to be much more effective against vehicles than the demolition truck. Two terrorists can successfully take out an average vehicle.

A deadly tactic involves having a Crazy Ivan plant bombs onto a terrorist then loading them into a flak track and drive it into enemy buildings. Additionally, packed into Allied IFVs, they turn them into a mini nuke truck.

Before sending terrorists, place a couple of tanks to soak up hits so the Terrorists do not die before reaching their target. It is helpful to place the tanks a short distance away from the target building so that splash damage from a prism tank will not catch the terrorists as well.

Another tactic is to fill flak tracks with Terrorists before using the Iron Curtain. The tracks can then be rushed into the enemy base, before deploying the terrorists inside the base. The flak tracks can then safely exit the enemy base.</p>

        <p style="color: black;" align="justify">By the closing months of Second World War, both Allied and Soviet usage of remote control nuclear delivery systems called demolition trucks claimed many of their enemies' lives. After the war, the Allies wished to minimize the chance of nuclear environmental poisoning as much as possible, and much of the Soviet nuclear arsenal, demolition trucks included, had been greatly neutered on the terms of their defeat.

However, this did not prevent Soviet-affiliated states to secretly develop such weapons. Libya was tasked with the design and assembly of the new generation of the demolition truck. The trucks were generally controlled not by remote - instead, they were steered to their destination by suicidal drivers. The demolition truck, albeit not as powerful as a tactical nuclear missile, can be very effective against enemy units, particularly if more than one is used. The trucks were very effective against base defenses, even if they were destroyed before they reached their target.

Soviet commanders could also use it in combination with the Iron Curtain to deliver an unstoppable and deadly attack. On the other hand, if an Allied commander was to obtain demolition trucks, a Chronosphere could be used to transport up to 9 trucks right inside an enemy's base.

Demolition trucks cost a fairly high amount to build and due to their low health, spamming them can backfire. To combat this, one or more Apocalypse tanks may be sent first to distract nearby defensive structures. Demolition trucks can then be used to target their base without being fired upon. Demolition trucks were very dangerous to keep inside bases because of their volatile nature. Allied Harriers can destroy a truck in a single hit, causing substantial damage if the truck is still within its base. Chrono legionnaires can be used to freeze and erase a demolition truck without setting off its payload. Alternatively, a single tank can be used to intercept the truck and destroy it before it reaches the vicinity of other friendly units.</p>

        <p style="color: black;" align="justify">Created by Soviet-aligned Iraq, these voluntary warriors went through tests that would have killed them if it had not been for their radiation suits. Each soldier was equipped with a nuclear battle suit[1] and a rad-cannon. They were quite fast and spoke in a raspy, tired voice.

In the Allied campaigns, they were only encountered in the occupied St. Louis during Operation: Free Gateway, where they demonstrated their abilities on captive civilians. A few of them were also deployed during Operation: Fallout. In the Soviet campaign of Yuri's Revenge, they became available during Operation: Romanov on the Run. They were also the only infantry unit apart from Cosmonauts capable of surviving on the Moon. While they are a potent anti-infantry unit with their rad-cannon's primary mode of fire (a concentrated radiation beam melting down enemy soldiers), their true power lies in the way they can deny an area to the enemy by irradiating the surface, so traversing it is lethal to infantry and damaging to vehicles. Their radiation field can penetrate water, making them capable of damaging submarines and revealing them. They are most effective at cutting off important choke points, such as passes, valleys, and even bridges. They were nearly matchless against any type of infantry, save for ones armed with long-ranged anti-infantry weaponry and flying infantry. The Desolator is only one of two types of infantry units authorized for the Moon assigment. However, they have to remain immobile while deploying their cannon and can be easily taken out by enemy snipers, heavier vehicles or airborne units. Their weapon is also completely useless against robotic units such as robot tanks. It is useful to keep a few desolators around a Soviet base, as an effective counter against a Nighthawk rush carrying engineers or Navy SEALs. If timed just right, one can irradiate the landing zone before the SEALs arrive, causing them to instantly die the moment they leave the transport. However, if done too late, the SEALs will kill the desolator; the Nighthawk itself might also pick off the desolator if there is absolutely no anti-air defense. Nonetheless, the desolator is the Soviets' only equivalent to a "ranged sniper" unit, capable of picking off stray engineers who try to breach the base. The desolator is also a favorable unit to counter paratroopers, provided they can be transported fast enough to the drop zone. Desolator cannot harm infantry garrisoned in buildings. British snipers are not an effective counter against a large number of desolators due to their slow rate of fire. In large numbers, desolators can create a contamination zone more deadly than a nuclear missiles, and destroy nearly anything that comes through in a matter of moments. Strangely, a veteran desolator can withstand a nuke attack.

Desolators can be combined with captured Allied IFV's to make "poor man's demolition trucks"; essentially a smaller version of the Libyan demolition truck's blast damage and radius, but which will result in radioactive fallout, damaging infantry that passes within (only in Yuri's Revenge; in Red Alert 2, he has an upgraded rad-cannon). The combination may still have other values as desolator can still shoot on their primary mode only, even affecting IFV promotion tally from the kills. However destruction of IFV will still instantly kill any infantry inside, desolator included. Allied commanders are normally wary to have their air support pick off slow moving desolators before they can reach the heart of massed Allied infantry formations, but incredibly fast IFVs can quickly deliver a radioactive blast to their center.

They can also be used to cripple Yuri's economy, as slaves are very vulnerable to radiation, and it takes time to have the irradiated ground returning to normal after the desolator is no longer operating on it.

A single deployed desolator's radiation field can easily kill all infantry units (except other desolators) as well as any non-robotic light vehicles within its radius. However, deploying more desolators is still useful, as their radiation fields stack.</p>
