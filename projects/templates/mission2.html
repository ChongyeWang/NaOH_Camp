<div>
<h2 align="center" style="font-weight: bold;">Red Dawn</h2>
<img align="left" src="{% static "img/mission/soviet1.png" %}">
<h3  style="font-weight: bold;">Background</h3>
<p align="justify">As the USSR unleashes its forces on the US mainland, a newly appointed Soviet Commander is given the task of invading Washington D.C. by Premier Romanov himself. In this endeavor, he is assisted by Zofia as his intelligence officer.
The US was completely off guard and mostly unprotected while the Soviets had been preparing for years.</p>

<h3  style="font-weight: bold;">Guide</h3>
<p align="justify">You don't need much in the way of strategy for this mission.  You'll start with enough units, 
and gain enough reinforcements along the way, that you can simply overwhelm the Allied 
defenses and march your way right to the Pentagon without stopping.  But just in case…

Deploy your MCV where it stops, and then build a tesla reactor and a barracks.  You don't need 
an ore refinery for this mission, but you can build one if you really want to.  Once your 
barracks is complete, train an engineer and send him to follow your conscripts.

Speaking of your conscripts, immediately march them northeast.  They'll come across three 
deployed GI's at an intersection, and then more GI's in a small Allied base.  Simply storm the 
GI's with your conscripts and kill them with concentrated fire.  There is a broken bridge 
northwest of the Allied base, so send in your engineer to fix it.

Combine your conscripts with the reinforcements you'll receive, and then cross the bridge.  
You'll find an Allied defensive position with two pillboxes and a few deployed GI's.  Split up 
your conscripts into two groups and have them garrison the two nearby buildings.  Once the 
Allied defensive position is history, empty the buildings and enter this second Allied base.  
You'll find a few deployed GI's, but they'll be no match for your army of conscripts.  Ignore 
the airport in the base; you'll finish the mission well before you can get an airdrop.  
Lastly, as before, when you receive reinforcements, add them to your attack force.

Now head towards the Pentagon to the northeast.  You'll have to fight through four pillboxes 
and a few GI's to get there, but you should have more than enough conscripts to blow right 
through them.  When you get to the Pentagon, you'll receive even more reinforcements, 
including over a dozen rhino tanks.  You won't need them.  Just have your attack force target 
each of the five Pentagon sub-buildings, and the mission will end when you've destroyed them 
all.

Also of Note:

There are a slew of trucks on the map that you can destroy for useful crates.  Their locations 
are: in the drive-in parking lot (firepower), in the parking lot northeast of the Iwo Jima 
Victory Memorial (money), in the parking lot northwest of the drive-in (armor), at the docks 
east of your base (rank and speed), in the parking lot past the broken bridge northwest of the 
second Allied base (speed).

Also, if you repair the bridge northwest of the second Allied base, and travel past the 
bridge, you'll receive four rhino tanks in reinforcements.</p>

<h2 align="center" style="font-weight: bold;">Hostile Shore</h2>
<img align="left" src="{% static "img/mission/soviet2.png" %}">
<h3  style="font-weight: bold;">Background</h3>
<p align="justify">The United States was so surprised by the speed and ferocity of the Soviet invasion that the Soviets had already captured Washington DC, along with a few states on the eastern seaboard. Although the Americans were retreating, they were still putting up a fight. Soviet leaders discovered that the Americans were building a navy in Florida.

In order to prevent the Allied Navy from interfering with Soviet operations, General Vladimir and a young commander were dispatched to eliminate the Allied naval base that was capable of sending out strike fleets along the Atlantic Ocean.</p>

<h3  style="font-weight: bold;">Guide</h3>
<p align="justify">Watch the dreadnought smack the Allied coastal defenses, and then take charge of your troops 
once you're able.  When you've finished off the pillboxes, you'll receive an MCV.  Deploy it 
where it stops.  Then build a tesla reactor, an ore refinery, a barracks, and finally a naval 
yard.  Once you have the naval yard, spend the rest of your money building submarines.

Meanwhile, move your land forces west, and have them shoot the barrels next to the two ore 
refineries.  That will destroy the refineries.  Then have them start sweeping south, 
destroying any Allied units that get in their way.  Eventually you'll come to the north shore 
of the harbor, and there you'll find a hotel.  If you destroy the hotel you'll get a promotion 
crate.

Keep moving your forces south/southwest until they reach the Allied base.  Ignore the frequent 
video sequences and attack the Allied defenders.  At some point you'll receive four submarines 
in reinforcements.  Keep them where they are, and add your submarines to them.  At some point 
after that, the Allies will attack your naval yard with several destroyers.  If you have six 
or more submarines, then they should be able to defeat the enemy destroyers on their own, and 
you can keep guiding your land forces.  Otherwise, guide your submarines manually and make 
sure they do the job.  Then just continue the land battle until all of the Allied forces are 
dead.

Also of Note:

Along the northern edge of the map are two oil derricks, and next to them to the east is a 
truck with a firepower crate in it.  Also, in the middle of the map, you'll find a McBurger 
Kong restaurant with a money crate in it.

<img align="left" src="{% static "img/mission/soviet3.png" %}">
<h3  style="font-weight: bold;">Background</h3>
<p align="justify">Several American forces were sent to establish an emergency base around the World Trade Center and protect the city in the wake of a Soviet invasion. Yuri saw this as an excellent opportunity to field-test his newest invention, the Psychic beacon. He exercised his discretion and sent the up-and-coming best Soviet Commander to the city.

The strike force was composed of a Soviet MCV with four Psi-Corps troopers from Yuri. The base was established southwest of the World Trade Center garrison in Manhattan.</p>

<h3  style="font-weight: bold;">Guide</h3>
<p align="justify">You find yourself in New York. Deploy your MCV and build a refinery, then
barracks, start training engineers and conscripts – lots of them. Build
another refinery then a war factory.
Capture the oil rigs outside your base and defend them with a couple of sentry
guns, fill up the thin building just to the right of the entrance to the base
and the big building outside the base. Once the war factory is built, build 3
or 4 V3 launchers and then start cranking out rhino tanks. Yuri will helpfully
send you a collection of psychic men, use one to take control of the civilian
truck outside the oil rigs and use it to drive round the map revealing the enemy. 
Move your V3 launchers north east, along the road that's inside your base,
until you reach the end of the road. Use the civilian truck to reveal the enemy
base set up there and use the V3 launchers to take it out from there. There
should be a pill box, some barracks and a filled up building, take them all
out. Then bring the V3 launchers back into your base with the tanks, and send a
group of them out the base towards the bridge opposite. Send the civilian truck
down there to reveal a load of pill boxes, use the V3 launchers to take them
out, keep a few tanks and psychics to defence them. Move your way down the
bridge clearing the area. Use the truck to reveal the enemy base surrounding
the battle lab, then use the same tactic of attacking the base from a safe
distance with the V3 launchers. Once you have some clear area, bring your other
tanks down and build a few Flak Track's with an engineer in one. Proceed to
move your tanks and V3 launchers into the base, once you're far enough in, use
the tanks to finish the base off and then bring the Flak Track's down with the
engineer and capture the battle lab, then surround the psychic beacon with
everything you've got, it won't be difficult to defend. The flak tracks will
take care of air units, otherwise, once the time is up. Mission Accomplished.</p>

<h2 align="center" style="font-weight: bold;">Home Front</h2>
<img align="left" src="{% static "img/mission/soviet4.png" %}">
<h3  style="font-weight: bold;">Background</h3>
<p align="justify">The Korean Navy, fulfilling its obligation to its US allies, had decided to attack the USSR on its own soil, planning a landing in the area of Vladivostok. Their ships were tracked down by Zofia en route to their target, which gave the USSR enough time to prepare a response.

At the suggestion of Yuri, an up-and-coming commander was sent into the mission by Premier Romanov instead of sending General Vladimir back from defense organization in the heart of the United States.</p>

<h3  style="font-weight: bold;">Guide</h3>
<p align="justify">This is a mission with a trick to it.  If you know the trick, it is very easy.  Otherwise, 
you'll have to do more work.  Regardless, deploy your MCV where it is, and then start your 
base like normal.  Once you have a barracks, put three or four flak cannons near the 
lighthouse.  When the timer hits 5:30, a pair of harrier jets will attack your base, and 
you'll be attacked by more harrier jets for the rest of the mission.  Also train ten 
conscripts and have them garrison the two houses east of your base.  Get a second miner going, 
and then start cranking out rhino tanks.

When the timer runs out, the Koreans will land some tanks and GI's on the south shore.  The 
garrisoned conscripts plus one tank can hold off the attack.  Two destroyers will also attack 
your naval yard, but they'll completely ignore your submarine, even if you attack with it.  So 
you can destroy the two destroyers with your lone sub.  Just be sure to repair the naval yard 
while it's under fire.  You might want to build another sub or two just to be safe.

Once the battle is over, send your rhino tanks to the eastern edge of the map, about a third 
of the way down.  They should find a shore with a nearby lighthouse.  This is the point where 
the Koreans will start up their base, but they'll have to transport in their military units 
and their MCV using amphibious transports.  If you have tanks stationed there, you can either 
destroy the transports before they unload, or you can quickly kill the enemy units right after 
they unload.  Once you've destroyed all of the enemy units, the mission should end.

<h2 align="center" style="font-weight: bold;">City of Lights</h2>
<img align="left" src="{% static "img/mission/soviet5.png" %}">
<h3  style="font-weight: bold;">Background</h3>
<p align="justify">As US President Michael Dugan was forced to go into exile in Canada, he called for the rest of the world to unite against the Soviet onslaught. France in particular promised its thanks due to their General Rene Lyon and were considering to possibly ally themselves with the USA to resist the communist aggression. In order to prevent that alliance from forming Premier Romanov, at Yuri's behest, ordered the famed Soviet Commander to infiltrate Paris and level the city. Full invasions and occupation of the city were entirely out of the question, so instead it would be a terror mission to shift Europeans away from supporting American forces actively (provided that resources in Europe will be supplied to their home guard rather than to help a faraway country, like the United States).

The Soviet embassy in Paris constructed (in secret without Lyon's notice) a Soviet Barracks and a Tesla Coil and have provisions to operate the base in full effects. Reinforcements are provided in clandestine penetration to carry everything needed, minimally. Soviet Engineers have identified that a large monument in Paris, the Eiffel Tower, may be "monumental" in destroying an Allied defence force stationed there.

The mission's actual goals were to escort safely 3 or more Tesla troopers to power up the Eiffel Tower, creating a gigantic Tesla Coil that will destroy the Allied Forces in Paris and strike fear into European hearts by storm.

</p>

<h3  style="font-weight: bold;">Guide</h3>
<p align="justify">Take your starting conscripts and have them garrison a building to the west.  Basically, 
you'll want to advance west building by building -- or by pairs of buildings, to increase your 
firepower -- killing Allied troops as you go.  Eventually you'll come to an oil derrick, and 
you can use one of your engineers to capture the derrick so you can earn more money to create 
even more conscripts.

North of the oil derrick you'll get a single flak track added to your arsenal.  Add it to your 
conscripts and keep going north.  You'll find a soccer field guarded by two tanks and four 
GI's.  Just charge in and kill them, and feel free to use the nearby barrels to help damage 
the tanks.

Continuing north you'll come to a street leading northeast.  Follow the street and you'll 
receive some tesla troopers in reinforcements.  Add them to your attack force and keep going.  
Eventually you'll find an Allied defensive position with two pillboxes and four GI's.  Again, 
use brute force to kill them, and then send the tesla troopers to the Paris Tower.

When the tesla troopers get to the Paris Tower, the tower will turn into a super tesla coil 
with great range, power, and speed.  It will be able to kill any Allied unit with one hit, so 
you won't have to defend it.  The Allies, meanwhile, will suddenly decide to attack, and most 
will charge your starting position.  Keep cranking out conscripts and eventually they'll kill 
all of the Allied attackers.</p>

<img align="left" src="{% static "img/mission/soviet6.png" %}">
<h3  style="font-weight: bold;">Background</h3>
<p align="justify">As the USSR controls much of the US mainland and holds a firm grip over France, the leadership of the Soviet Union holds a conference, in which Yuri is announced as the new supreme commander of the Soviet Army, much to the chagrin of Vladimir. Ignoring the General and leaving the exhausted Romanov, the psychic orders an invasion of Pearl Harbor at Hawaii, to prevent the American Pacific Fleet from regrouping with its Korean allies and posing a threat to the Soviet navy on the Pacific Ocean.</p>

<h3  style="font-weight: bold;">Guide</h3>
<p align="justify">Get your base going with a couple of refineries and once your barracks are up,
start building flak canons to the  south west of the base, and once you have a
war factory build flak tracks and have them waiting by the flak canons, build a
shipyard and start cranking out subs, also start the mass tank building.
To survive the initial onslaught you will need plenty of subs and plenty of
flak defence and the odd Tesla coil positioned at the edge of the water. Some
dreadnaughts will arrive for you, but these aren't much help at the start. Also
train an engineer and put them into a transport with a couple of tanks send
them to the south, send them across the south of the map travelling west.
Soon the allied fleet will start arriving, just watch and wait for now. When
your transport reaches the Western island capture the airport and collect the
money crate, leave a couple of tanks on the island.
The attack will shortly begin, first with destroyers, then as soon as they are
all gone move your subs out and target the aircraft carriers, then finish off
the fleet. If you have enough subs, try and clear the entire sea, move the subs
round the sea and try to remove all destroyers. Also start building transports.
The airport may come under attack as well the safest thing to do for now is
parachute some extra conscripts to defend the airport.
Be aware of late attacks from allied aircraft carriers, but your subs should be
able to deal with those before they cause any problems. Start parachuting
troops onto the island and filling up any structures you can find.
You will find the allied shipyard fairly central to the island between 2 prism
towers, if you have enough subs you should be able to finish this fleet of
destroyers easily as well as the shipyard. They will try and rebuild it, but
just leave your subs there to keep the navy under control, once you have 10 or
so transports full of tanks, move them onto the island, the best place to land
is on the south east where there is little defence. Parachute some troops onto
the small area with the Airforce command centre to destroy that. Move the tanks
through the island, and finish the ground forces off. Make sure you cover the
whole island, once everything has been destroyed, mission accomplished.</p>

<h2 align="center" style="font-weight: bold;">Chrono Defense</h2>
<img align="left" src="{% static "img/mission/soviet7.png" %}">
<h3  style="font-weight: bold;">Background</h3>
<p align="justify">When the Premier fell ill, Yuri took the lead and started issuing orders. His first assignment, given to the young Soviet Commander, was to defend the Soviets' own research laboratory in the Ural Mountains.

Openly challenged by Vladimir, who called the psychic a traitor, he cut off the General and ordered the Commander to, once again, defend the laboratory. The laboratorium itself contained a final research and development project on the Apocalypse tank.</p>

<h3  style="font-weight: bold;">Guide</h3>
<p align="justify">You'll begin the mission with 20,000 credits, so start spending your money like crazy.  Build 
a tesla reactor first so you can also build flak cannons, sentry guns, and tesla coils right 
away (without cutting power to your base).  Then build an ore refinery and tell the miner to 
collect ore from the resource patch near the southern entrance to your base.  That will create 
a little extra room, which you'll need.  Then build the rest of your base, and try to fit 
everything in so you'll still have room to maneuver.  Attacks will come primarily from the 
west and south, so protect those entrances the most.

The first Allied attack will consist of GI's and a sniper, and will come from the south.  So 
move all of your infantry and dog units out of the way to the north, and let your sentry gun 
take care of them.  (The sniper has a very long range, and he'll pick off your units if 
they're too close.)  The next attacks will have tanks and GI's, so start cranking out tesla 
troopers.  The dogs you start with can mow down the enemy GI's but you'll need the most help 
with the tanks, and tesla troopers are good at killing tanks.  Plus you can use the tesla 
troopers with your tesla coils later when you have time to build the coils.

While building mostly tesla troopers, don't neglect your dogs.  The Allies will use spies 
quite a bit in this mission, and they'll try to shut down your power just before attacks.  So 
try to keep a dog or two at all of the entrances to your base.

After the first wave of attacks, you'll learn that the Allies have a propaganda truck in the 
northwestern village.  Send a few conscripts over there to kill the truck.  The truck can't 
attack them or run over them, so you can just direct the conscripts to walk to the area the 
truck patrols, and ignore them while you work on your base defenses.  The conscripts will 
eventually destroy the truck, and you'll be awarded with a money crate and a satellite image 
of the map.

Keep building tesla coils and tesla reactors.  With six or seven tesla coils around the 
perimeter of your base, you should be all right.  Construct a few apocalypse tanks as well for 
a mobile defense.  If you need extra money, three trucks will appear on the map after the 
third or fourth wave of Allied attacks.  If you've already gotten the satellite image of the 
map, then the trucks will stick out like a sore thumb when they appear.  Killing the trucks 
will net you two money crates and an armor crate.  Plus, you can also take over three oil 
derricks on the eastern side of the map.  Be prepared to defend them, however, because they're 
right next to an area where the Allies will airdrop in troops, and they'll be attacked often.

There are about six waves of Allied attacks, and you'll be informed when the last one arrives.  
Remember that you only have to protect your battle lab.  If things start going badly, just 
pull in your defenses and concentrate on protecting the lab.  The Allies don't use their 
military units very well – they'll drive their prism tanks right up to your defenses, for 
example – and a few apocalypse tanks can probably destroy everything the Allies throw against 
you all by themselves.</p>

</div>

<div>
<h2 align="center" style="font-weight: bold;">Desecration</h2>
<img align="left" src="{% static "img/mission/soviet8.png" %}">
<h3  style="font-weight: bold;">Background</h3>
<p align="justify">In recognition of his deeds (or rather, his speed of crediting himself with military victories), General Vladimir was appointed the head of the American occupational forces. He enjoyed full benefits of his position, experiencing the American lifestyle, but grew disillusioned with the Soviet leadership as Yuri continued to slowly poison Romanov and was appointed the Supreme Commander of the Soviet armed forces instead. His aggravation turned to open hostility as he called the psychic a traitor during a video conference.

After a daring defence of the Ural Mountains battle lab, Premier Romanov was found dead, apparently shot to death by Vladimir (with an odd video tape used as proof of this crime). Yuri promptly declared the General a non-person, ordered his erasure from historical records and ordered his best general to capture him.

In fact Vladimir seemed to have fully embraced the soft capitalist American lifestyle (one more charge to be added to the list of his alleged crimes according to Yuri).</p>

<h3  style="font-weight: bold;">Guide</h3>
<p align="justify">Move your tanks and conscripts to the east and your desecrators to the north.  That will clear 
room around your MCV, allowing you to deploy it.  The enemy will send three airdrops at your 
base in short order.  The first will arrive from the north (where your desecrators should 
already be stationed).  The next will come from the southwest, and the third from the east 
(between the bunkers).  Just move your desecrators to the next landing zone as soon as you see 
a plane start to drop off conscripts, and you should be able to defeat the attacks easily.

Meanwhile, move your two apocalypse tanks to the north and have them destroy the Lincoln 
Memorial.  You'll get two crates for this: one money crate and one promotion crate.  Have the 
tanks grab both crates, and then bring them back to your base.  Also move your starting 
conscripts into the bunker near the resource patches.  As soon as you build a barracks, train 
an engineer to fix the other bunker, and then fill it with conscripts.  Bunkers are tough, but 
you'll still want to support them with some tesla coils and flak cannons (to defeat V3 
rockets).  Leave your desecrators near the northern bunker, since that's where most of the 
infantry attacks will come from.

Notice that the resource patches near your base aren't self-sustaining.  That means you'll 
need to make your attacks count because you won't be able to afford to waste any money.  So 
get your base going and then construct about a dozen apocalypse tanks.  Send the tanks east 
(north of the bridge), and they'll discover the resource patches that are being used by the 
enemy.  Don't destroy the refinery you'll find there.  Save it so you can capture it later.  
Go ahead and take down the Washington Monument while you're in the area, and you'll earn a 
money crate for your troubles.  Also feel free to kill any miners you come across.

Then send your tanks south to deal with the Brown enemy base.  With a dozen apocalypse tanks, 
the destruction should be relatively quick and painless.  But keep pumping out apocalypse 
tanks to add to your attack force.  South of the Brown base will be a broken bridge.  If you 
repair the bridge, you'll find six trucks (with crates) and the Jefferson Memorial.  If you 
keep running out of money, this little area will solve all your problems, and it's lightly 
defended with only a couple of tanks and tesla troopers.

Now just march your apocalypse tanks northeast to the White House.  Destroy everything you 
come across, and then send a spy into the White House to complete the mission.

Also of Note:

You can also destroy the Smithsonian Museum and Castle for extra crates.</p>

<img align="left" src="{% static "img/mission/soviet9.png" %}">
<h3  style="font-weight: bold;">Background</h3>
<p align="justify">General Vladmir was found cowering in a closet by a Soviet officer. However, he was disposed offscreen as Yuri diverted the Commander's attention to other important matters from seeing the gunshot. So far, US President Michael Dugan had evaded Soviet capture, but he was at last tracked to San Antonio, Texas - hiding in the Alamo. Yuri tasked his General to mind-control the President, so as to easily submit the weakening American forces and surrender the United States all over it.</p>

<h3  style="font-weight: bold;">Guide</h3>
<p align="justify">Watch the demonstration of the Allied defenses, and then take control of your two psi 
troopers.  One psi trooper will almost immediately take control of an IFV, and that's all 
right.  The IFV will prove useful.  Use the second psi trooper to control one of the deployed 
GI's guarding the nearby barracks and battle lab.  Your GI will immediately start firing on 
the other GI, and you can use your IFV to finish off whichever GI survives.  Then use your 
free psi trooper to take control of the two engineers and have them capture the barracks and 
battle lab.

You'll start the mission with 4000 credits, so go ahead and train ten GI's and two spies.  
Then send your GI's to the intersection south of your base, and have them destroy the 
patrolling IFV that will eventually show up.  Next have the GI's move east around the north 
end of the enemy base (being careful of the prism towers) and have them kill a patrol of two 
attack dogs and one GI.  That will clear the north end of the map of enemy units.

So send your IFV and psi trooper through the clear area of the map to the Light Blue base on 
the eastern side.  Park the IFV behind the western corner of the base so it can attack the 
pillbox without the pillbox being able to fight back.  Use your psi trooper to control the 
sniper, and have the sniper kill the deployed GI's in the base.  Then switch control to the 
grizzly tank, and have it and your IFV take out the remaining pillbox.  Finally, use the IFV 
and tank to kill the IFV patrolling on the eastern side of the Dark Blue base.  The tank and 
IFV will now be useless to you, so have them charge at the Dark Blue base and get destroyed.

Control the sniper again, and have him kill all of the seals and attack dogs at the two 
entrances to the Dark Blue base.  Then bring your sniper, a spy, and a psi trooper to the 
western entrance (but out of range of the prism towers).  Send the spy in to infiltrate a 
power plant, then bring the sniper to the entrance of the base so that it can kill any 
infantry units that get into range, and finally tell your psi trooper to target the President 
(in the blue suit). The psi trooper will only have to travel to the entrance of the base to 
get within range of the President, and the sniper will prevent any enemy units from attacking 
him.

Also of Note:

There are six crates in the southeastern corner of the map.  The eastern crates will give 
money, and the northern crates will give a promotion, increased firepower, and improved 
defense.  You can create a pretty powerful IFV if you want to.</p>

<h2 align="center" style="font-weight: bold;">Weather Alliance</h2>
<img align="left" src="{% static "img/mission/soviet10.png" %}">
<h3  style="font-weight: bold;">Background</h3>
<p align="justify">With most of the world under direct control of the USSR, there were still loose ends to tie up. As Yuri reminisced about his past, he revealed to the Commander that one man was responsible for the Allies' technological superiority - Albert Einstein. His latest invention, the Weather control device, posed a significant threat to the Soviet war machine, so he ordered its destruction. Countering it, Zofia "took" a nuclear authorization (most likely from Vladimir) to the commander.

</p>

<h3 style="font-weight: bold;">Guide</h3>
<p align="justify">This is a mission where you'll have to work quickly.  It won't take long for the Allies to 
attack you by the land, sea, and air, and so you'll need to put up a variety of defenses right 
away.  First things first, though: move your MCV a little to the north and then deploy it.  
Move your conscripts to the northern shore between the sentry guns, and leave your tanks where 
they are.  Since you have a radar tower already, you can immediately start building tesla 
coils, and you should build two: one next to your radar, and one on the southern shore near 
wherever you decide to place your naval yard.

Because tesla coils drain your energy by so much, the first structure you should build is a 
tesla reactor.  Then you can build your base in the regular fashion, but don't delay building 
a naval yard very long.  You should definitely build a naval yard before building a war 
factory because the Allies will send dolphins against you, and you have to have some 
submarines in the water before the dolphins arrive if you want to save your naval yard.

The first attacks will feature GI's.  An amphibious transport will land at your northern 
shore, between your sentry guns, and the guns plus your conscripts should be able to handle 
them.  The next amphibious attack will arrive next to your radar station, but placing a telsa 
coil there should defeat it.  After that you'll face an amphibious attack where grizzly tanks 
are transported in rather than GI's, but your rhino tanks should be able to run over and stop 
it.  And then you'll face repeated attacks by rocketeers, destroyers, dolphins, and aircraft 
carriers.  Where they land depends on your base, so you need to put up several flak cannons 
(or flak troopers) to protect yourself, plus build up a fleet.

Speaking of your fleet, once you have six or seven submarines, take them to the beach where 
the game suggested that you make your landing.  You'll find an enemy naval yard there, and you 
should take it out.  There is also another naval yard to the southeast, and once you take it 
out as well, you won't have to worry about enemy ships any more.  But you will have to deal 
with seals, so keep your submarines near the beach so they can intercept the seals as they 
approach your base.

When you have superiority on the seas, build two or three dreadnoughts and start pounding the 
enemy coastal defenses.  (You can get a reinforcement dreadnought by sending a ship to the 
southwestern corner of the map.)  Take out the pillboxes, tanks, and any prism towers you can 
find.  Use your scorpions to scout around and ``detect'' prism tower locations.  Then once the 
beach is clear, start building apocalypse tanks and V3 rocket launchers, and land them on the 
beach.  If you haven't built a nuclear silo yet, now is the time to do so.

When you have about six apocalypse tanks and three V3 rocket launchers on the beach, send them 
northeast.  You'll find a war factory, and you can either capture it or destroy it.  Enemy 
miners will also be in the area, but if you attack one, the Allies will send a bunch of 
grizzly tanks at you.  Use the V3 rocket launchers to destroy enemy prism towers when you find 
them, because the towers will be able to kill your apocalypse tanks in one hit.

Once you've cleared a route to the battle lab, send in an engineer to capture the building.  
The map will expand, and you'll be shown the weather control device in the northwestern 
corner.  Just use a nuclear strike to take out the device, and you'll finish the mission.

Also of Note:

There is a tech outpost on an island in the southeastern part of the map.</p>

<h3  style="font-weight: bold;">Background</h3>
<p align="justify">After the destruction of the Weather Control Device, Yuri invited the Commander, now Chief of the Red Army, to the Kremlin to "congratulate him in person". However, before the Commander set out to Moscow, a video tape was delivered to communications officer Zofia. On the tape, recorded by Romanov just before his death, the Premier denounced Yuri and revealed him as his assassin. The Commander, accompanied by Zofia, then left for Moscow, with an army, to overthrow the traitor.</p>

<h3  style="font-weight: bold;">Guide</h3>
<p align="justify">I found this to be probably the hardest in the game. You will have to face and
endless stream of attacks from Yuri's forces and yet again, defence and
preparation is key. All you have to do is destroy the Kremlin, for this you
will need 2 nuclear strikes.
When the mission starts get building, you'll need 2 refineries . Also make sure
you leave the south western corner of the map clear for your nuclear reactor
and nuclear silo later on. Move the 2 Kirov airships slightly north east above
the path that leads into your base, this should keep enemy infantry under
control. As soon as you have a radar start building Tesla coils – lots
of them, build a wall of about 6 of them, and once you have a battle lab build
Apocalypse tanks. Get more ore miners too, next build 3 flak canons on each
edge of the base. Kirov airships will come down on the West of the map heading
south and from east of the map heading south west, 3 flak canons should do, but
have additional flak tracks ready too. Build a nuclear reactor and sell your
Tesla reactors and crucially build a silo and put it as far south west as you
can get it, right into the corner of the map.
You will probably lose all your units except the Apocalypse tanks and these can
also be used against the long stream of Kirov airships. Just endlessly build
tanks and keep a very solid wall of Tesla coils and you should be ok. The units
you want to take out early are the Psychics who take control of your units, it
is more productive to kill them rather than your own units. You will just have
to put up with the iron curtain for this mission, and to be honest the computer
doesn't use it particularly well.
The key to this level I found, was cash flow, always make sure you have enough
ore miners, without cash flow you can't keep building faster than they can destroy.
Once your first nuke is ready, target the centre base of the Kremlin, save and
then Nuke it, if the health bar doesn't go to yellow, you haven't hit it
properly and try again, reload and make sure it is the centre base of the building.
Work hard of keeping your defence solid – there is only 10 minutes to
hold firm while your nuke re charges. When the nuke is ready nuke the Kremlin
in exactly the same place, if it isn't destroyed, re load and try nuking it
again. But with the Kremlin gone – mission accomplished, phew!

<h3  style="font-weight: bold;">Background</h3>
<p align="justify">With Yuri dead, the Soviet Union's supremacy was all but sealed - all that was left was mopping up the remaining Allied Forces and ensuring their defeat. Thanks to Zofia, who browsed the late Yuri's archives, the Allies' ultimate weapon, the Chronosphere, was discovered. Located at Point Hope, Alaska, its destruction would be the last building block of the Soviet global domination.</p>

<h3  style="font-weight: bold;">Guide</h3>
<p align="justify">First things first, train lots of Tesla troops you will be under attack before
you can form much of a defence, build a refinery and have 10 or so Tesla troops
standing by for Allied troops Chrono-ing in. Also have a Tesla coil (you'll
need more power), or a Sentry gun ready to put in place. Also have flak
troopers ready to remove incoming Rocketeers.
Once you've help off these attacks, build the battle lab and shipyard, start
building subs, you'll only need 10 or so. Build a nuclear reactor and sell
Tesla reactors and get a nuke silo going. Also start cranking out Apocalypse
tanks. And on top of all this build a fair amount of flak defence.
Once you have enough subs send them towards the enemy bay (North West) Early on
the whole bay will be revealed, and this gives you plenty of nuking targets as
well as an air raid siren to make it more dramatic. Target the destroyers
first, then finish off the 2 shipyards. Build 2 dreadnaughts to help you along
with the attack on the landing bay, and of course, nuke it when you can. Use
the subs to reveal all the sea area. In terms of how many tanks you will need,
there really is no limit, I would have to say 20 is an absolute minimum

– that's 10 transports. To be honest when you run out or ore, that's
usually a good time to go.
If you can get a good sight of the shore above the cliff edge, use the
dreadnaughts to take out as much as possible, move your way up. If a prism
tower gets a shot of you it will be revealed and you can shoot at it.
When you are ready move all your transports across to the landing bay. Once
you've landed, move fast! Speed is the key to this mission from here onwards.
Eliminate all of the allied base in this area then head north. Crucially
destroy the war factory and construction yard there. Head north, enemy units
will Chrono in there masses, in the form of IFV's prism tanks and tanks. Head
north pushing your way though basses and defences until you reach the most
northern point, do remember though the more you destroy the faster the tanks
get promoted which will help later on
When you have moved north enough, Kirov airships will appear, these can be used
if you want, but I've always been too frustrated by their slowness. That said
it can be useful to send them South West where there are some prism towers on
top of a cliff. Send the tanks west and then south to the west of the cliff.
You will probably lose your airships to the crazy numbers of IFV's. Once the
area is clear, move south west.
Here you will encounter heavy base defences that you will need to remove with
your tanks, push your way through. Once you are through this base, you are
nearly there, fight through more defences and walls to the south west, and
inside you will find the Chronosphere – take it out and the mission and
indeed the whole of Red Alert 2 is complete – Congratulations.</p>
