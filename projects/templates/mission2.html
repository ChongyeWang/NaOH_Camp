<p align="justify">As the USSR unleashes its forces on the US mainland, a newly appointed Soviet Commander is given the task of invading Washington D.C. by Premier Romanov himself. In this endeavor, he is assisted by Zofia as his intelligence officer.
The US was completely off guard and mostly unprotected while the Soviets had been preparing for years.</p>


<p align="justify">在苏联向美国大陆释放力量时，罗曼诺夫总理亲自给新任命的苏军司令官下达了侵略华盛顿特区的任务。 在这项工作中，佐菲亚（Zofia）协助他担任情报官员。 在苏联人准备多年之后，美国完全措手不及，几乎没有受到保护。</p>

<h3  style="font-weight: bold;">Guide</h3>
<p align="justify">You don't need much in the way of strategy for this mission.  You'll start with enough units, 
and gain enough reinforcements along the way, that you can simply overwhelm the Allied 
defenses and march your way right to the Pentagon without stopping.  But just in case…

Deploy your MCV where it stops, and then build a tesla reactor and a barracks.  You don't need 
an ore refinery for this mission, but you can build one if you really want to.  Once your 
barracks is complete, train an engineer and send him to follow your conscripts.

Speaking of your conscripts, immediately march them northeast.  They'll come across three 
deployed GI's at an intersection, and then more GI's in a small Allied base.  Simply storm the 
GI's with your conscripts and kill them with concentrated fire.  There is a broken bridge 
northwest of the Allied base, so send in your engineer to fix it.

Combine your conscripts with the reinforcements you'll receive, and then cross the bridge.  
You'll find an Allied defensive position with two pillboxes and a few deployed GI's.  Split up 
your conscripts into two groups and have them garrison the two nearby buildings.  Once the 
Allied defensive position is history, empty the buildings and enter this second Allied base.  
You'll find a few deployed GI's, but they'll be no match for your army of conscripts.  Ignore 
the airport in the base; you'll finish the mission well before you can get an airdrop.  
Lastly, as before, when you receive reinforcements, add them to your attack force.

Now head towards the Pentagon to the northeast.  You'll have to fight through four pillboxes 
and a few GI's to get there, but you should have more than enough conscripts to blow right 
through them.  When you get to the Pentagon, you'll receive even more reinforcements, 
including over a dozen rhino tanks.  You won't need them.  Just have your attack force target 
each of the five Pentagon sub-buildings, and the mission will end when you've destroyed them 
all.

Also of Note:

There are a slew of trucks on the map that you can destroy for useful crates.  Their locations 
are: in the drive-in parking lot (firepower), in the parking lot northeast of the Iwo Jima 
Victory Memorial (money), in the parking lot northwest of the drive-in (armor), at the docks 
east of your base (rank and speed), in the parking lot past the broken bridge northwest of the 
second Allied base (speed).

Also, if you repair the bridge northwest of the second Allied base, and travel past the 
bridge, you'll receive four rhino tanks in reinforcements.</p>

<p align="justify">您不需要太多方法来执行此任务。您将从足够的单位开始，并在此过程中获得足够的增援，以使您可以压倒盟军的防御能力，直奔五角大楼而无需停止。但以防万一……将MCV部署在停下来的地方，然后建造特斯拉反应堆和营房。您不需要精炼厂来完成此任务，但是如果您真的愿意，可以建造一个。营房完成后，请培训工程师并派他去应征您。说到您的应征者，请立即向东北进发。他们将在一个十字路口遇到三个已部署的GI，然后在一个小的盟军基地中遇到更多的GI。只需用您的应征者冲进GI，然后用集中火力将其杀死。盟军基地西北部有一座断桥，请派遣工程师进行修复。将您的应征者与您将获得的援军结合起来，然后越过桥。您会发现一个有两个药盒和几个已部署GI的盟军防御阵地。将应征入伍者分成两组，让他们驻扎在附近的两座建筑物中。一旦盟军的防御阵地成为历史，就清空建筑物并进入第二个盟军基地。您会发现一些已部署的GI，但它们与您的应征入伍者大相径庭。忽略基地内的机场；您可以在完成空投之前完成任务。最后，和以前一样，当您收到增援时，将其添加到攻击部队中。现在前往东北的五角大楼。您必须通过四个药盒和几个GI才能到达目的地，但是您应该有足够的应征者可以直接通过它们。当您到达五角大楼时，您会得到更多的援军，包括十几个犀牛坦克。您将不需要它们。只要让攻击部队瞄准五角大楼的五个子建筑物中的每个，就可以在摧毁所有五角大楼后结束任务。另请注意：地图上有大量卡车，您可以销毁这些卡车以获得有用的箱子。它们的位置是：驾车入场停车场（火力），硫磺岛胜利纪念堂东北的停车场（钱），驾车入场西北的停车场（装甲），东面的码头基地（等级和速度），位于第二联盟基地（速度）西北断桥处的停车场。另外，如果您维修第二个盟军基地西北部的桥梁，并经过桥梁，您将收到四个装满加固物的犀牛坦克。</p>

<h3  style="font-weight: bold;">Background</h3>
<p align="justify">The United States was so surprised by the speed and ferocity of the Soviet invasion that the Soviets had already captured Washington DC, along with a few states on the eastern seaboard. Although the Americans were retreating, they were still putting up a fight. Soviet leaders discovered that the Americans were building a navy in Florida.

In order to prevent the Allied Navy from interfering with Soviet operations, General Vladimir and a young commander were dispatched to eliminate the Allied naval base that was capable of sending out strike fleets along the Atlantic Ocean.</p>

<p align="justify">美国对苏联入侵的速度和凶猛感到惊讶，以至于苏联人已经占领了华盛顿特区以及东部沿海的几个州。 尽管美国人正在撤退，但他们仍在进行斗争。 苏联领导人发现美国人在佛罗里达州建立海军。 为了防止盟军干扰苏联的行动，弗拉基米尔将军和一位年轻的指挥官被派去消灭了能够在大西洋上派出打击舰队的盟军海军基地。</p>


<h3  style="font-weight: bold;">Guide</h3>
<p align="justify">Watch the dreadnought smack the Allied coastal defenses, and then take charge of your troops 
once you're able.  When you've finished off the pillboxes, you'll receive an MCV.  Deploy it 
where it stops.  Then build a tesla reactor, an ore refinery, a barracks, and finally a naval 
yard.  Once you have the naval yard, spend the rest of your money building submarines.

Meanwhile, move your land forces west, and have them shoot the barrels next to the two ore 
refineries.  That will destroy the refineries.  Then have them start sweeping south, 
destroying any Allied units that get in their way.  Eventually you'll come to the north shore 
of the harbor, and there you'll find a hotel.  If you destroy the hotel you'll get a promotion 
crate.

Keep moving your forces south/southwest until they reach the Allied base.  Ignore the frequent 
video sequences and attack the Allied defenders.  At some point you'll receive four submarines 
in reinforcements.  Keep them where they are, and add your submarines to them.  At some point 
after that, the Allies will attack your naval yard with several destroyers.  If you have six 
or more submarines, then they should be able to defeat the enemy destroyers on their own, and 
you can keep guiding your land forces.  Otherwise, guide your submarines manually and make 
sure they do the job.  Then just continue the land battle until all of the Allied forces are 
dead.

Also of Note:

Along the northern edge of the map are two oil derricks, and next to them to the east is a 
truck with a firepower crate in it.  Also, in the middle of the map, you'll find a McBurger 
Kong restaurant with a money crate in it.
</p>

<p align="justify">观看无畏的打击盟军的沿海防御，然后在有能力的情况下掌管您的部队。完成药丸盒包装后，您将收到一份MCV。将其部署在停止的地方。然后建造一个特斯拉反应堆，一个矿石精炼厂，一个营房，最后一个造船厂。拥有海军造船厂后，将剩余的钱用于建造潜艇。同时，将陆军向西移动，让他们在两个矿石精炼厂旁边射击桶。那将摧毁炼油厂。然后让他们开始向南席卷，摧毁任何妨碍其前进的盟军部队。最终，您会来到海港的北岸，然后在那里找到一家酒店。如果您破坏了酒店，您将获得晋升箱子。继续向南/西南移动部队，直到到达盟军基地为止。忽略频繁的视频序列，攻击盟军的防御者。在某个时候，您会收到四艘增援潜艇。将它们保留在原处，然后将潜艇添加到其中。此后的某个时候，盟军将用几艘驱逐舰攻击您的海军战场。如果您有六艘或更多潜艇，那么它们应该能够自行击败敌方驱逐舰，并且您可以继续引导您的陆军。否则，请手动引导您的潜艇并确保其完成任务。然后继续进行陆战，直到所有盟军死亡。还要注意：在地图的北部边缘有两个石油井架，在它们的东边是一辆装有火力板条箱的卡车。此外，在地图中间，您会发现一间装有钱箱的McBurger Kong餐厅。</p>

<p align="justify">Several American forces were sent to establish an emergency base around the World Trade Center and protect the city in the wake of a Soviet invasion. Yuri saw this as an excellent opportunity to field-test his newest invention, the Psychic beacon. He exercised his discretion and sent the up-and-coming best Soviet Commander to the city.

The strike force was composed of a Soviet MCV with four Psi-Corps troopers from Yuri. The base was established southwest of the World Trade Center garrison in Manhattan.</p>

<p align="justify">几支美国部队被派往世界贸易中心附近建立应急基地，并在苏联入侵后保护该市。 尤里（Yuri）认为这是一次现场测试他的最新发明Psychic beacon的绝佳机会。 他行使了自己的决定权，并向该市派出了新锐的最佳苏联指挥官。 打击部队由苏联MCV和来自尤里（Yuri）的四名Psi-Corps士兵组成。 该基地建立在曼哈顿世界贸易中心驻军的西南方。</p>

<h3  style="font-weight: bold;">Guide</h3>
<p align="justify">You find yourself in New York. Deploy your MCV and build a refinery, then
barracks, start training engineers and conscripts – lots of them. Build
another refinery then a war factory.
Capture the oil rigs outside your base and defend them with a couple of sentry
guns, fill up the thin building just to the right of the entrance to the base
and the big building outside the base. Once the war factory is built, build 3
or 4 V3 launchers and then start cranking out rhino tanks. Yuri will helpfully
send you a collection of psychic men, use one to take control of the civilian
truck outside the oil rigs and use it to drive round the map revealing the enemy. 
Move your V3 launchers north east, along the road that's inside your base,
until you reach the end of the road. Use the civilian truck to reveal the enemy
base set up there and use the V3 launchers to take it out from there. There
should be a pill box, some barracks and a filled up building, take them all
out. Then bring the V3 launchers back into your base with the tanks, and send a
group of them out the base towards the bridge opposite. Send the civilian truck
down there to reveal a load of pill boxes, use the V3 launchers to take them
out, keep a few tanks and psychics to defence them. Move your way down the
bridge clearing the area. Use the truck to reveal the enemy base surrounding
the battle lab, then use the same tactic of attacking the base from a safe
distance with the V3 launchers. Once you have some clear area, bring your other
tanks down and build a few Flak Track's with an engineer in one. Proceed to
move your tanks and V3 launchers into the base, once you're far enough in, use
the tanks to finish the base off and then bring the Flak Track's down with the
engineer and capture the battle lab, then surround the psychic beacon with
everything you've got, it won't be difficult to defend. The flak tracks will
take care of air units, otherwise, once the time is up. Mission Accomplished.</p>

<p align="justify">您会发现自己在纽约。部署您的MCV并建造炼油厂，然后建造兵营，开始培训工程师和应征者–其中很多。建立另一个炼油厂，然后建立一个战争工厂。将石油钻机收留在基地外，并用几把哨兵为它们辩护，填满基地入口右侧的薄建筑物和基地外的大建筑物。建造战争工厂后，建造3或4个V3发射器，然后开始制造犀牛坦克。尤里（Yuri）会帮您送去一批通灵的人，用它们来控制油井架外的民用卡车，并用它来驱动地图，揭示敌人。沿着基地内的道路向东北移动V3启动器，直到到达路的尽头。使用民用卡车露出在那里建立的敌军基地，并使用V3发射器将其从那里取出。应该有一个药箱，一些营房和一栋已建成的建筑物，把它们全部拿出来。然后将V3发射器与坦克一起带回您的基地，并将其中的一组从基地发送到对面的桥。将民用卡车送到那里，露出一堆药丸盒，使用V3发射器将其取出，保留一些坦克和通灵装置来防御它们。沿着桥往下移动，清理区域。使用卡车发现战斗实验室周围的敌方基地，然后使用与V3发射器安全距离攻击基地的相同策略。一旦您拥有一定的净空区域，就将其他战车放下，并与一名工程师一起建造一些Flak Track。继续移动后，将战车和V3发射器移入基地，一旦到达足够远的地方，就可以使用战车完成基地的建造，然后与工程师放下Flak Track的低空并占领战斗实验室，然后用您拥有的所有东西，捍卫并不难。襟翼轨道将照顾空气单位，否则，一旦时间到了。任务完成。</p>

<h3  style="font-weight: bold;">Background</h3>
<p align="justify">The Korean Navy, fulfilling its obligation to its US allies, had decided to attack the USSR on its own soil, planning a landing in the area of Vladivostok. Their ships were tracked down by Zofia en route to their target, which gave the USSR enough time to prepare a response.

At the suggestion of Yuri, an up-and-coming commander was sent into the mission by Premier Romanov instead of sending General Vladimir back from defense organization in the heart of the United States.</p>

<p align="justify">为了履行对美国盟国的义务，朝鲜海军决定在自己的领土上进攻苏联，并计划在符拉迪沃斯托克地区进行登陆。 佐菲亚在追踪目标的途中追查了他们的船只，这给了苏联足够的时间准备回应。 在尤里的建议下，罗曼诺夫总理将一名崭露头角的指挥官派往了特派团，而不是将弗拉基米尔将军从美国中部的国防组织遣返了。</p>

<h3  style="font-weight: bold;">Guide</h3>
<p align="justify">This is a mission with a trick to it.  If you know the trick, it is very easy.  Otherwise, 
you'll have to do more work.  Regardless, deploy your MCV where it is, and then start your 
base like normal.  Once you have a barracks, put three or four flak cannons near the 
lighthouse.  When the timer hits 5:30, a pair of harrier jets will attack your base, and 
you'll be attacked by more harrier jets for the rest of the mission.  Also train ten 
conscripts and have them garrison the two houses east of your base.  Get a second miner going, 
and then start cranking out rhino tanks.

When the timer runs out, the Koreans will land some tanks and GI's on the south shore.  The 
garrisoned conscripts plus one tank can hold off the attack.  Two destroyers will also attack 
your naval yard, but they'll completely ignore your submarine, even if you attack with it.  So 
you can destroy the two destroyers with your lone sub.  Just be sure to repair the naval yard 
while it's under fire.  You might want to build another sub or two just to be safe.

Once the battle is over, send your rhino tanks to the eastern edge of the map, about a third 
of the way down.  They should find a shore with a nearby lighthouse.  This is the point where 
the Koreans will start up their base, but they'll have to transport in their military units 
and their MCV using amphibious transports.  If you have tanks stationed there, you can either 
destroy the transports before they unload, or you can quickly kill the enemy units right after 
they unload.  Once you've destroyed all of the enemy units, the mission should end.
</p>

<p align="justify">这是一个有技巧的任务。如果您知道窍门，那很容易。否则，您将不得不做更多的工作。无论如何，将MCV部署在原来的位置，然后像平常一样启动您的基地。拥有营房后，在灯塔附近放置三到四枚高射炮。当计时器到达5:30时，将有一对of弹机攻击您的基地，在接下来的任务中，您将受到更多more弹机的攻击。还要训练十个应征者，并让他们驻扎在您基地以东的两所房屋中。再去找一个矿工，然后开始制造犀牛坦克。当计时器用完时，韩国人将在南岸降落一些坦克和地理标志。驻军应征者加一辆坦克可以阻止进攻。两艘驱逐舰也将攻击您的海军战场，但是即使您用它进行攻击，它们也会完全无视您的潜艇。因此，您可以使用单独的潜艇摧毁这两个驱逐舰。只要确保在海军舰船着火时对其进行修理即可。为了安全起见，您可能希望再建一个或两个潜艇。战斗结束后，将犀牛坦克发送至地图的东部，大约下降三分之一。他们应该找到附近有灯塔的海岸。这是朝鲜人开始建立基地的关键，但他们将不得不使用两栖运输工具在其军事单位和MCV中进行运输。如果您在那里部署了坦克，则可以在运输工具卸下之前销毁运输工具，也可以在卸下敌机后立即杀死它们。摧毁所有敌方单位后，任务应结束。</p>

<h3  style="font-weight: bold;">Background</h3>
<p align="justify">As US President Michael Dugan was forced to go into exile in Canada, he called for the rest of the world to unite against the Soviet onslaught. France in particular promised its thanks due to their General Rene Lyon and were considering to possibly ally themselves with the USA to resist the communist aggression. In order to prevent that alliance from forming Premier Romanov, at Yuri's behest, ordered the famed Soviet Commander to infiltrate Paris and level the city. Full invasions and occupation of the city were entirely out of the question, so instead it would be a terror mission to shift Europeans away from supporting American forces actively (provided that resources in Europe will be supplied to their home guard rather than to help a faraway country, like the United States).

The Soviet embassy in Paris constructed (in secret without Lyon's notice) a Soviet Barracks and a Tesla Coil and have provisions to operate the base in full effects. Reinforcements are provided in clandestine penetration to carry everything needed, minimally. Soviet Engineers have identified that a large monument in Paris, the Eiffel Tower, may be "monumental" in destroying an Allied defence force stationed there.

The mission's actual goals were to escort safely 3 or more Tesla troopers to power up the Eiffel Tower, creating a gigantic Tesla Coil that will destroy the Allied Forces in Paris and strike fear into European hearts by storm.

</p>

<p align="justify">当美国总统迈克尔·杜根（Michael Dugan）被迫流亡加拿大时，他呼吁世界其他地区团结起来抵抗苏联的猛攻。特别是法国，由于他们的里昂·里昂将军而答应了感谢，并考虑与美国结盟以抵抗共产主义的侵略。为了防止该联盟组建尤曼·罗曼诺夫总理，应尤里的命令，下令著名的苏联指挥官渗透到巴黎并夷平这座城市。完全入侵和占领这座城市完全是不可能的，因此，将欧洲人从积极支持美军转移到欧洲将是一个恐怖的任务（前提是欧洲的资源将提供给他们的家庭警卫而不是帮助遥远的地方国家（例如美国）。苏联驻巴黎大使馆（秘密地未经里昂通知）建造了一个苏联营房和一个特斯拉线圈，并有充分利用该基地的条件。加强了秘密通道的穿透力，以最小化地运送所需的一切物品。苏联工程师已经确定，巴黎的一座大型纪念碑埃菲尔铁塔可能是摧毁驻扎在该地的盟军防御部队的“纪念碑”。任务的实际目标是安全地护送3名或更多的特斯拉士兵为埃菲尔铁塔加电，制造出巨大的特斯拉线圈，它将摧毁巴黎的盟军并通过风暴将恐惧打入欧洲人的心。</p>

<h3  style="font-weight: bold;">Guide</h3>
<p align="justify">Take your starting conscripts and have them garrison a building to the west.  Basically, 
you'll want to advance west building by building -- or by pairs of buildings, to increase your 
firepower -- killing Allied troops as you go.  Eventually you'll come to an oil derrick, and 
you can use one of your engineers to capture the derrick so you can earn more money to create 
even more conscripts.

North of the oil derrick you'll get a single flak track added to your arsenal.  Add it to your 
conscripts and keep going north.  You'll find a soccer field guarded by two tanks and four 
GI's.  Just charge in and kill them, and feel free to use the nearby barrels to help damage 
the tanks.

Continuing north you'll come to a street leading northeast.  Follow the street and you'll 
receive some tesla troopers in reinforcements.  Add them to your attack force and keep going.  
Eventually you'll find an Allied defensive position with two pillboxes and four GI's.  Again, 
use brute force to kill them, and then send the tesla troopers to the Paris Tower.

When the tesla troopers get to the Paris Tower, the tower will turn into a super tesla coil 
with great range, power, and speed.  It will be able to kill any Allied unit with one hit, so 
you won't have to defend it.  The Allies, meanwhile, will suddenly decide to attack, and most 
will charge your starting position.  Keep cranking out conscripts and eventually they'll kill 
all of the Allied attackers.</p>


<p align="justify">拿起您的应征入伍者，让他们驻守在西侧的建筑物中。基本上，您将希望通过建造建筑物或成对的建筑物来推进西面建筑物，以增加火力-随行杀戮盟军。最终，您将来到一架井架上，并且可以使用您的一名工程师来捕获井架，这样您就可以赚更多的钱来制造更多的应征入伍者。在井架以北，您将在军械库中添加一条断断续续的履带。将其添加到您的应征者，继续往北走。您会发现一个由两个坦克和四个GI守卫的足球场。只需充电并杀死它们，即可随时使用附近的枪管帮助损坏坦克。继续向北，您会到达一条通向东北的街道。沿着街道行驶，您会收到一些特斯拉士兵的增援。将它们添加到您的攻击力量中并继续前进。最终，您会发现一个拥有两个药盒和四个GI的盟军防御阵地。同样，使用蛮力杀死他们，然后将特斯拉士兵派到巴黎铁塔。当特斯拉士兵到达巴黎铁塔时，该塔将变成具有巨大射程，功率和速度的超级特斯拉线圈。一击就能杀死任何盟军单位，因此您不必捍卫它。同时，同盟国将突然决定进攻，而大多数将冲锋陷阵。不断招募新兵，最终他们将杀死所有盟军攻击者。</p>

<p align="justify">As the USSR controls much of the US mainland and holds a firm grip over France, the leadership of the Soviet Union holds a conference, in which Yuri is announced as the new supreme commander of the Soviet Army, much to the chagrin of Vladimir. Ignoring the General and leaving the exhausted Romanov, the psychic orders an invasion of Pearl Harbor at Hawaii, to prevent the American Pacific Fleet from regrouping with its Korean allies and posing a threat to the Soviet navy on the Pacific Ocean.</p>

<h3  style="font-weight: bold;">Guide</h3>
<p align="justify">Get your base going with a couple of refineries and once your barracks are up,
start building flak canons to the  south west of the base, and once you have a
war factory build flak tracks and have them waiting by the flak canons, build a
shipyard and start cranking out subs, also start the mass tank building.
To survive the initial onslaught you will need plenty of subs and plenty of
flak defence and the odd Tesla coil positioned at the edge of the water. Some
dreadnaughts will arrive for you, but these aren't much help at the start. Also
train an engineer and put them into a transport with a couple of tanks send
them to the south, send them across the south of the map travelling west.
Soon the allied fleet will start arriving, just watch and wait for now. When
your transport reaches the Western island capture the airport and collect the
money crate, leave a couple of tanks on the island.
The attack will shortly begin, first with destroyers, then as soon as they are
all gone move your subs out and target the aircraft carriers, then finish off
the fleet. If you have enough subs, try and clear the entire sea, move the subs
round the sea and try to remove all destroyers. Also start building transports.
The airport may come under attack as well the safest thing to do for now is
parachute some extra conscripts to defend the airport.
Be aware of late attacks from allied aircraft carriers, but your subs should be
able to deal with those before they cause any problems. Start parachuting
troops onto the island and filling up any structures you can find.
You will find the allied shipyard fairly central to the island between 2 prism
towers, if you have enough subs you should be able to finish this fleet of
destroyers easily as well as the shipyard. They will try and rebuild it, but
just leave your subs there to keep the navy under control, once you have 10 or
so transports full of tanks, move them onto the island, the best place to land
is on the south east where there is little defence. Parachute some troops onto
the small area with the Airforce command centre to destroy that. Move the tanks
through the island, and finish the ground forces off. Make sure you cover the
whole island, once everything has been destroyed, mission accomplished.</p>


<p align="justify">让您的基地与几个炼油厂一起运行，一旦您的军营建立起来，就开始在基地西南方向建造防空炮，一旦您有战争工厂建造防空炮道，并让它们在防空炮旁等待，就建造一个造船厂并开始发动潜艇，也开始建造大型坦克。为了在最初的猛攻中幸存下来，您将需要大量潜艇和许多防弹装置，以及位于水边的奇特斯拉线圈。有些畏惧将送达您，但这些起初并没有太大帮助。还要培训一名工程师，并用几个坦克将它们放到运输工具中，将其发送到南方，再将它们发送到地图的南部，然后向西行驶。不久，盟军舰队将开始抵达，只需要观察并等待现在。当您的交通工具到达西部岛屿时，请抓住机场并收集钱箱，然后在该岛上留下几个坦克。攻击将很快开始，首先是驱逐舰，然后在它们全部消失后将潜艇移出并瞄准航母，然后结束舰队。如果您有足够的潜艇，请尝试清理整个海洋，将潜艇绕海移动，然后尝试卸下所有驱逐舰。也开始建造交通工具。机场现在也可能受到攻击，最安全的事情是降落伞以保卫机场。请注意盟军航空母舰的后期袭击，但是您的潜艇应该能够对付它们，以免造成任何问题。开始将伞兵降落到岛上，并填满所有可以找到的建筑物。您会发现盟军造船厂位于2座棱镜塔之间的岛屿中心，如果您有足够的潜艇，您应该能够轻松完成这艘驱逐舰船队以及造船厂的建造。他们会尝试重建它，但只要将潜艇留在这里以控制海军，一旦您有10辆装满坦克的运输工具，将它们移到岛上，最好的降落地点是在东南部小防守。与空军指挥中心一起将一些部队降落到该小区域，以摧毁该区域。将坦克推过小岛，并结束地面部队。一旦一切都被摧毁，任务完成，请确保覆盖整个岛屿。</p>

<p align="justify">You'll begin the mission with 20,000 credits, so start spending your money like crazy.  Build 
a tesla reactor first so you can also build flak cannons, sentry guns, and tesla coils right 
away (without cutting power to your base).  Then build an ore refinery and tell the miner to 
collect ore from the resource patch near the southern entrance to your base.  That will create 
a little extra room, which you'll need.  Then build the rest of your base, and try to fit 
everything in so you'll still have room to maneuver.  Attacks will come primarily from the 
west and south, so protect those entrances the most.

The first Allied attack will consist of GI's and a sniper, and will come from the south.  So 
move all of your infantry and dog units out of the way to the north, and let your sentry gun 
take care of them.  (The sniper has a very long range, and he'll pick off your units if 
they're too close.)  The next attacks will have tanks and GI's, so start cranking out tesla 
troopers.  The dogs you start with can mow down the enemy GI's but you'll need the most help 
with the tanks, and tesla troopers are good at killing tanks.  Plus you can use the tesla 
troopers with your tesla coils later when you have time to build the coils.

While building mostly tesla troopers, don't neglect your dogs.  The Allies will use spies 
quite a bit in this mission, and they'll try to shut down your power just before attacks.  So 
try to keep a dog or two at all of the entrances to your base.

After the first wave of attacks, you'll learn that the Allies have a propaganda truck in the 
northwestern village.  Send a few conscripts over there to kill the truck.  The truck can't 
attack them or run over them, so you can just direct the conscripts to walk to the area the 
truck patrols, and ignore them while you work on your base defenses.  The conscripts will 
eventually destroy the truck, and you'll be awarded with a money crate and a satellite image 
of the map.

Keep building tesla coils and tesla reactors.  With six or seven tesla coils around the 
perimeter of your base, you should be all right.  Construct a few apocalypse tanks as well for 
a mobile defense.  If you need extra money, three trucks will appear on the map after the 
third or fourth wave of Allied attacks.  If you've already gotten the satellite image of the 
map, then the trucks will stick out like a sore thumb when they appear.  Killing the trucks 
will net you two money crates and an armor crate.  Plus, you can also take over three oil 
derricks on the eastern side of the map.  Be prepared to defend them, however, because they're 
right next to an area where the Allies will airdrop in troops, and they'll be attacked often.

There are about six waves of Allied attacks, and you'll be informed when the last one arrives.  
Remember that you only have to protect your battle lab.  If things start going badly, just 
pull in your defenses and concentrate on protecting the lab.  The Allies don't use their 
military units very well – they'll drive their prism tanks right up to your defenses, for 
example – and a few apocalypse tanks can probably destroy everything the Allies throw against 
you all by themselves.</p>


<p align="justify">您将以20,000个积分开始执行任务，因此开始疯狂地花钱。首先建造一个特斯拉反应堆，这样您就可以立即建造高射炮，哨兵和特斯拉线圈（不降低您的基础力量）。然后建立一个矿石精炼厂，并告诉矿工从基地南部入口附近的资源片中收集矿石。这将创建一个额外的空间，您将需要它。然后建立您的基地的其余部分，并尝试将所有东西都放入其中，以便您仍有回旋余地。攻击主要来自西部和南部，因此应尽可能保护这些入口。盟军的第一次进攻将由GI和狙击手组成，并将来自南方。因此，将所有步兵和战犬部队移到北部，让哨兵照顾他们。 （狙击手的射程很长，如果距离太近，他会接你的单位。）下一次攻击将有坦克和GI，因此请开动特斯拉士兵。您开始使用的狗可以割伤敌方的GI，但您需要的坦克最需要帮助，特斯拉士兵擅长杀死坦克。另外，如果您有时间建造特斯拉线圈，可以稍后将特斯拉士兵与特斯拉线圈一起使用。在建造大多数特斯拉士兵时，请不要忽略您的狗。盟军将在此任务中大量使用间谍，并且他们将在攻击前尝试关闭您的电源。因此，尽量在基地的所有入口处养一两个狗。经过第一波攻击后，您将了解到盟军在西北村庄有一辆宣传卡车。发送一些应征者到那儿杀死卡车。卡车无法攻击它们或在其上撞过，因此您只需指挥应征入伍者步行到卡车巡逻的区域，而在进行基本防御时便不理会它们。应征入伍者最终将摧毁卡车，您将获得金钱箱和地图的卫星图像。继续建造特斯拉线圈和特斯拉反应堆。在基座的周围有六个或七个特斯拉线圈，您应该没事。建造一些末日坦克以及用于移动防御。如果您需要额外的钱，在第三或第四波盟军袭击之后，三辆卡车将出现在地图上。如果您已经获得了地图的卫星图像，则卡车出现时会像拇指一样伸出来。杀死卡车会为您带来两个金钱箱子和一个装甲箱子。另外，您还可以在地图的东边接管三个井架。但是，要做好保卫他们的准备，因为它们就在盟军将空投部队的区域附近，并且它们会经常遭到攻击。大约有六波盟军进攻浪潮，最后一次袭击到来时会通知您。请记住，您只需要保护战斗实验室即可。如果一切开始变糟，则只需加紧防御并集中精力保护实验室即可。盟军的部队没有很好地利用自己的装备-例如，他们会把棱镜式坦克推向您的防线-某些末日坦克可能会摧毁盟军自己对付您的一切东西。</p>

<img align="left" src="{% static "img/mission/soviet8.png" %}">
<h3  style="font-weight: bold;">Background</h3>
<p align="justify">In recognition of his deeds (or rather, his speed of crediting himself with military victories), General Vladimir was appointed the head of the American occupational forces. He enjoyed full benefits of his position, experiencing the American lifestyle, but grew disillusioned with the Soviet leadership as Yuri continued to slowly poison Romanov and was appointed the Supreme Commander of the Soviet armed forces instead. His aggravation turned to open hostility as he called the psychic a traitor during a video conference.

After a daring defence of the Ural Mountains battle lab, Premier Romanov was found dead, apparently shot to death by Vladimir (with an odd video tape used as proof of this crime). Yuri promptly declared the General a non-person, ordered his erasure from historical records and ordered his best general to capture him.

In fact Vladimir seemed to have fully embraced the soft capitalist American lifestyle (one more charge to be added to the list of his alleged crimes according to Yuri).</p>


<p align="justify">为了表彰他的所作所为（或更确切地说，他以军事上的胜利获得称赞的速度），弗拉基米尔将军被任命为美国占领军负责人。他享有自己的职位所享有的全部好处，经历了美国的生活方式，但是随着尤里继续缓慢地毒害罗曼诺夫并被任命为苏维埃武装部队最高司令，他对苏维埃领导层感到幻灭。他在电视会议上称通奸者为叛徒时，他的加剧加剧了敌意。在对乌拉尔山脉战斗实验室进行了大胆的防御之后，总理罗曼诺夫被发现死了，显然是弗拉基米尔（Vladimir）射死的（用奇怪的录像带证明了这一罪行）。尤里迅速宣布将军为非人，下令将其从历史记录中删除，并命令其最高将军将其俘虏。实际上，弗拉基米尔似乎已经完全接受了软资本主义的美国生活方式（根据尤里（Yuri）的说法，在他所指控的犯罪清单中还增加了一项指控）。</p>

<h3  style="font-weight: bold;">Guide</h3>
<p align="justify">Move your tanks and conscripts to the east and your desecrators to the north.  That will clear 
room around your MCV, allowing you to deploy it.  The enemy will send three airdrops at your 
base in short order.  The first will arrive from the north (where your desecrators should 
already be stationed).  The next will come from the southwest, and the third from the east 
(between the bunkers).  Just move your desecrators to the next landing zone as soon as you see 
a plane start to drop off conscripts, and you should be able to defeat the attacks easily.

Meanwhile, move your two apocalypse tanks to the north and have them destroy the Lincoln 
Memorial.  You'll get two crates for this: one money crate and one promotion crate.  Have the 
tanks grab both crates, and then bring them back to your base.  Also move your starting 
conscripts into the bunker near the resource patches.  As soon as you build a barracks, train 
an engineer to fix the other bunker, and then fill it with conscripts.  Bunkers are tough, but 
you'll still want to support them with some tesla coils and flak cannons (to defeat V3 
rockets).  Leave your desecrators near the northern bunker, since that's where most of the 
infantry attacks will come from.

Notice that the resource patches near your base aren't self-sustaining.  That means you'll 
need to make your attacks count because you won't be able to afford to waste any money.  So 
get your base going and then construct about a dozen apocalypse tanks.  Send the tanks east 
(north of the bridge), and they'll discover the resource patches that are being used by the 
enemy.  Don't destroy the refinery you'll find there.  Save it so you can capture it later.  
Go ahead and take down the Washington Monument while you're in the area, and you'll earn a 
money crate for your troubles.  Also feel free to kill any miners you come across.

Then send your tanks south to deal with the Brown enemy base.  With a dozen apocalypse tanks, 
the destruction should be relatively quick and painless.  But keep pumping out apocalypse 
tanks to add to your attack force.  South of the Brown base will be a broken bridge.  If you 
repair the bridge, you'll find six trucks (with crates) and the Jefferson Memorial.  If you 
keep running out of money, this little area will solve all your problems, and it's lightly 
defended with only a couple of tanks and tesla troopers.

Now just march your apocalypse tanks northeast to the White House.  Destroy everything you 
come across, and then send a spy into the White House to complete the mission.

Also of Note:

You can also destroy the Smithsonian Museum and Castle for extra crates.</p>


<p align="justify">将战车和应征者移至东部，亵渎者移至北部。这样可以清理MCV周围的空间，从而可以进行部署。敌人将在短时间内向您的基地发送3次空投。第一个将从北部到达（您的亵渎者应已驻扎在那里）。下一个将来自西南，第三个将来自东部（在the堡之间）。看到飞机开始降落时，只要将亵渎者移动到下一个着陆区，您就应该能够轻松击败攻击。同时，将您的两个启示录坦克移至北部，并摧毁林肯纪念堂。为此，您将获得两个箱子：一个金钱箱子和一个促销箱子。让坦克抓住两个箱子，然后将它们带回基地。还将您的应征入伍者移到资源补丁附近的掩体中。建造营房后，立即训练工程师修复另一个掩体，然后在其上充入应征者。掩体很强悍，但您仍然需要使用一些特斯拉线圈和高射炮来支援它们（打败V3火箭）。将亵渎者放在北部掩体附近，因为这是大多数步兵袭击的来源。请注意，您基地附近的资源补丁并不能自我维持。这意味着您需要使攻击受到重视，因为您将无力浪费任何金钱。因此，让您的基地发展起来，然后建造大约十二个启示录坦克。将坦克向东（桥北）发送，他们会发现敌人正在使用的资源补丁。不要破坏您在那找到的精炼厂。保存它，以便以后捕获。在该地区时，继续前进并走下华盛顿纪念碑，您将为自己的麻烦赚钱。也可以随意杀死您遇到的任何矿工。然后将您的战车向南发送，以对付布朗敌军基地。有了十二个启示录坦克，破坏应该相对迅速且无痛。但是，请继续抽出末日坦克，以增加攻击力。布朗基地以南的一座断桥。如果维修桥梁，您会发现六辆卡车（带板条箱）和杰斐逊纪念堂。如果您一直没钱了，这个小区域将解决您的所有问题，并且只有两辆战车和特斯拉士兵可以轻松防御。现在，只需将您的启示录坦克向东北行进至白宫。销毁遇到的一切，然后派间谍进入白宫以完成任务。另请注意：您还可以销毁史密森尼博物馆和城堡以获得额外的箱子。</p>

<p align="justify">General Vladmir was found cowering in a closet by a Soviet officer. However, he was disposed offscreen as Yuri diverted the Commander's attention to other important matters from seeing the gunshot. So far, US President Michael Dugan had evaded Soviet capture, but he was at last tracked to San Antonio, Texas - hiding in the Alamo. Yuri tasked his General to mind-control the President, so as to easily submit the weakening American forces and surrender the United States all over it.</p>


<p align="justify">弗拉德米尔将军被一名苏联军官发现在壁橱里畏缩。 然而，由于尤里把指挥官的注意力从枪击事件转移到其他重要事项上，所以他不在屏幕上。 到目前为止，美国总统迈克尔·杜根（Michael Dugan）躲避了苏联的俘虏，但最后被追踪到德克萨斯州圣安东尼奥市-躲藏在阿拉莫。 尤里（Yuri）要求将军控制总统，以便轻易地使衰弱的美军屈服并在整个美国投降。</p>

<h3  style="font-weight: bold;">Guide</h3>
<p align="justify">Watch the demonstration of the Allied defenses, and then take control of your two psi 
troopers.  One psi trooper will almost immediately take control of an IFV, and that's all 
right.  The IFV will prove useful.  Use the second psi trooper to control one of the deployed 
GI's guarding the nearby barracks and battle lab.  Your GI will immediately start firing on 
the other GI, and you can use your IFV to finish off whichever GI survives.  Then use your 
free psi trooper to take control of the two engineers and have them capture the barracks and 
battle lab.

You'll start the mission with 4000 credits, so go ahead and train ten GI's and two spies.  
Then send your GI's to the intersection south of your base, and have them destroy the 
patrolling IFV that will eventually show up.  Next have the GI's move east around the north 
end of the enemy base (being careful of the prism towers) and have them kill a patrol of two 
attack dogs and one GI.  That will clear the north end of the map of enemy units.

So send your IFV and psi trooper through the clear area of the map to the Light Blue base on 
the eastern side.  Park the IFV behind the western corner of the base so it can attack the 
pillbox without the pillbox being able to fight back.  Use your psi trooper to control the 
sniper, and have the sniper kill the deployed GI's in the base.  Then switch control to the 
grizzly tank, and have it and your IFV take out the remaining pillbox.  Finally, use the IFV 
and tank to kill the IFV patrolling on the eastern side of the Dark Blue base.  The tank and 
IFV will now be useless to you, so have them charge at the Dark Blue base and get destroyed.

Control the sniper again, and have him kill all of the seals and attack dogs at the two 
entrances to the Dark Blue base.  Then bring your sniper, a spy, and a psi trooper to the 
western entrance (but out of range of the prism towers).  Send the spy in to infiltrate a 
power plant, then bring the sniper to the entrance of the base so that it can kill any 
infantry units that get into range, and finally tell your psi trooper to target the President 
(in the blue suit). The psi trooper will only have to travel to the entrance of the base to 
get within range of the President, and the sniper will prevent any enemy units from attacking 
him.

Also of Note:

There are six crates in the southeastern corner of the map.  The eastern crates will give 
money, and the northern crates will give a promotion, increased firepower, and improved 
defense.  You can create a pretty powerful IFV if you want to.</p>


<p align="justify">观看盟军防御的示范，然后控制您的两个psi士兵。一名psi士兵几乎可以立即控制IFV，没关系。 IFV将被证明是有用的。使用第二个psi士兵控制部署的GI之一，以保护附近的兵营和战斗实验室。您的GI将立即开始向另一个GI发射，并且您可以使用IFV结束幸存的任何GI。然后，使用免费的psi士兵控制两名工程师，并让他们占领营房和战斗实验室。您将以4000个学分开始任务，因此继续训练10个GI和2个间谍。然后将您的GI发送到基地南侧的十字路口，让它们摧毁巡逻的IFV，这些IFV最终会出现。接下来，让GI沿着敌人基地北端向东移动（注意棱锥塔），并杀死两只攻击犬和一个GI的巡逻队。这将清除敌方单位地图的北端。因此，将您的IFV和psi士兵通过地图的清晰区域发送到东侧的浅蓝色基地。将IFV停在基地的西角后面，这样它就可以攻击药箱，而药箱无法反击。使用psi士兵控制狙击手，让狙击手杀死基地中已部署的GI。然后将控制切换到灰熊水箱，让它和IFV取出剩余的药盒。最后，使用IFV和坦克杀死在深蓝色基地东面巡逻的IFV巡逻队。坦克和IFV现在对您无用了，因此让它们在深蓝色基地冲锋并被摧毁。再次控制狙击手，让他杀死深蓝色基地的两个入口处的所有海豹和攻击犬。然后将您的狙击手，一名间谍和一名psi士兵带到西侧入口（但不在棱镜塔的范围内）。派间谍进入发电厂，然后将狙击手带到基地的入口，这样它就可以杀死进入范围的任何步兵单位，最后告诉psi士兵以总统为目标（穿着蓝色西装）。 psi士兵只需走到基地入口即可到达总统的射程，而狙击手将阻止任何敌方单位攻击他。另请注意：在地图的东南角有六个箱子。东部的板条箱会给钱，而北部的板条箱会给人以晋升，增强火力和增强防御能力。您可以根据需要创建功能强大的IFV。</p>

<img align="left" src="{% static "img/mission/soviet10.png" %}">
<h3  style="font-weight: bold;">Background</h3>
<p align="justify">With most of the world under direct control of the USSR, there were still loose ends to tie up. As Yuri reminisced about his past, he revealed to the Commander that one man was responsible for the Allies' technological superiority - Albert Einstein. His latest invention, the Weather control device, posed a significant threat to the Soviet war machine, so he ordered its destruction. Countering it, Zofia "took" a nuclear authorization (most likely from Vladimir) to the commander.

</p>

<p align="justify">由于世界上大部分地区都在苏联的直接控制下，结局仍然很松散。 当尤里回忆起自己的过去时，他向司令透露，盟军的技术优势由一个人负责-爱因斯坦。 他的最新发明气象控制装置对苏联的战争机器构成了重大威胁，因此他下令销毁它。 对此，佐菲亚“向”指挥官“核”了核授权（很可能来自弗拉基米尔）。</p>

<h3 style="font-weight: bold;">Guide</h3>
<p align="justify">This is a mission where you'll have to work quickly.  It won't take long for the Allies to 
attack you by the land, sea, and air, and so you'll need to put up a variety of defenses right 
away.  First things first, though: move your MCV a little to the north and then deploy it.  
Move your conscripts to the northern shore between the sentry guns, and leave your tanks where 
they are.  Since you have a radar tower already, you can immediately start building tesla 
coils, and you should build two: one next to your radar, and one on the southern shore near 
wherever you decide to place your naval yard.

Because tesla coils drain your energy by so much, the first structure you should build is a 
tesla reactor.  Then you can build your base in the regular fashion, but don't delay building 
a naval yard very long.  You should definitely build a naval yard before building a war 
factory because the Allies will send dolphins against you, and you have to have some 
submarines in the water before the dolphins arrive if you want to save your naval yard.

The first attacks will feature GI's.  An amphibious transport will land at your northern 
shore, between your sentry guns, and the guns plus your conscripts should be able to handle 
them.  The next amphibious attack will arrive next to your radar station, but placing a telsa 
coil there should defeat it.  After that you'll face an amphibious attack where grizzly tanks 
are transported in rather than GI's, but your rhino tanks should be able to run over and stop 
it.  And then you'll face repeated attacks by rocketeers, destroyers, dolphins, and aircraft 
carriers.  Where they land depends on your base, so you need to put up several flak cannons 
(or flak troopers) to protect yourself, plus build up a fleet.

Speaking of your fleet, once you have six or seven submarines, take them to the beach where 
the game suggested that you make your landing.  You'll find an enemy naval yard there, and you 
should take it out.  There is also another naval yard to the southeast, and once you take it 
out as well, you won't have to worry about enemy ships any more.  But you will have to deal 
with seals, so keep your submarines near the beach so they can intercept the seals as they 
approach your base.

When you have superiority on the seas, build two or three dreadnoughts and start pounding the 
enemy coastal defenses.  (You can get a reinforcement dreadnought by sending a ship to the 
southwestern corner of the map.)  Take out the pillboxes, tanks, and any prism towers you can 
find.  Use your scorpions to scout around and ``detect'' prism tower locations.  Then once the 
beach is clear, start building apocalypse tanks and V3 rocket launchers, and land them on the 
beach.  If you haven't built a nuclear silo yet, now is the time to do so.

When you have about six apocalypse tanks and three V3 rocket launchers on the beach, send them 
northeast.  You'll find a war factory, and you can either capture it or destroy it.  Enemy 
miners will also be in the area, but if you attack one, the Allies will send a bunch of 
grizzly tanks at you.  Use the V3 rocket launchers to destroy enemy prism towers when you find 
them, because the towers will be able to kill your apocalypse tanks in one hit.

Once you've cleared a route to the battle lab, send in an engineer to capture the building.  
The map will expand, and you'll be shown the weather control device in the northwestern 
corner.  Just use a nuclear strike to take out the device, and you'll finish the mission.

There is a tech outpost on an island in the southeastern part of the map.</p>


<p align="justify">这是一项任务，您必须快速工作。盟国用不了多久就可以通过陆，海，空进攻您，因此您需要立即采取多种防御措施。不过，首先要做的是：将您的MCV稍微向北移动，然后进行部署。将应征入伍者移至哨兵之间的北岸，并将坦克停在原处。由于您已经拥有雷达塔，因此您可以立即开始建造特斯拉线圈，并且应该建造两个：一个在雷达旁边，一个在您决定放置海军舰船的地方附近的南岸。由于特斯拉线圈会消耗大量能量，因此您应该建造的第一个结构是特斯拉电抗器。然后，您可以按常规方式建立自己的基地，但不要拖延很长的海军造船厂。在建立战争工厂之前，您绝对应该先建立一个海军造船厂，因为盟军会向您派遣海豚，如果您想保存您的海军造船厂，则必须在海豚到达之前将一些潜艇放入水中。最初的攻击将以GI为特色。两栖运输车将降落在您的北部海岸，在您的哨兵之间，并且枪支和您的应征者应该能够处理它们。下一次两栖攻击将到达您的雷达站附近，但是在其中放置一个telsa线圈应该可以击败它。之后，您将面临两栖攻击，其中运输灰熊坦克而不是GI，但是您的犀牛坦克应该能够越过并阻止它。然后，您将面临火箭弹，驱逐舰，海豚和航空母舰的反复攻击。它们降落的位置取决于您的基地，因此您需要架起几架高射炮（或高射炮士兵）以保护自己，并建立一支舰队。说到您的舰队，一旦您拥有6或7艘潜水艇，就将它们带到海滩，游戏提示您进行降落。您会在那儿找到一个敌人的海军船坞，应该将其取出。东南还有另一个造船厂，一旦将其取出，您就不必再担心敌舰了。但是您将不得不处理海豹，因此请将您的潜水艇靠近海滩，以便它们在接近您的基地时可以拦截海豹。当您在海上具有优势时，建造两三个无畏舰并开始猛击敌人的沿海防御工事。 （您可以通过将船发送到地图的西南角来获得无畏的增强。）取出药盒，水箱和任何可以找到的棱柱塔。用你的蝎子四处寻找并``检测''棱镜塔的位置。然后，在海滩畅通无阻之后，就开始建造启示录坦克和V3火箭发射器，并将它们降落在海滩上。如果您尚未建造核发射井，现在是时候这样做了。当您在海滩上有大约六个启示录坦克和三个V3火箭发射器时，请将它们向东北发送。您会找到一个战争工厂，可以将其捕获或摧毁。敌方矿工也将在该地区，但如果您袭击一个，盟军将向您派送一堆灰熊坦克。找到敌人的棱镜塔后，请使用V3火箭发射器摧毁它们，因为它们可以一击就杀死您的末日坦克。清除通往战斗实验室的路线后，请派工程师来捕获建筑物。地图将展开，您将在西北角看到天气控制设备。只需使用核打击将设备取出，即可完成任务。还要注意：在地图的东南部的一个岛上有一个技术哨所。</p>

However, before the Commander set out to Moscow, a video tape was delivered to communications officer Zofia.

<h3  style="font-weight: bold;">Guide</h3>
<p align="justify">I found this to be probably the hardest in the game. You will have to face and
endless stream of attacks from Yuri's forces and yet again, defence and
preparation is key. All you have to do is destroy the Kremlin, for this you
will need 2 nuclear strikes.
When the mission starts get building, you'll need 2 refineries . Also make sure
you leave the south western corner of the map clear for your nuclear reactor
and nuclear silo later on. Move the 2 Kirov airships slightly north east above
the path that leads into your base, this should keep enemy infantry under
control. As soon as you have a radar start building Tesla coils – lots
of them, build a wall of about 6 of them, and once you have a battle lab build
Apocalypse tanks. Get more ore miners too, next build 3 flak canons on each
edge of the base. Kirov airships will come down on the West of the map heading
south and from east of the map heading south west, 3 flak canons should do, but
have additional flak tracks ready too. Build a nuclear reactor and sell your
Tesla reactors and crucially build a silo and put it as far south west as you
can get it, right into the corner of the map.
You will probably lose all your units except the Apocalypse tanks and these can
also be used against the long stream of Kirov airships. Just endlessly build
tanks and keep a very solid wall of Tesla coils and you should be ok. The units
you want to take out early are the Psychics who take control of your units, it
is more productive to kill them rather than your own units. You will just have
to put up with the iron curtain for this mission, and to be honest the computer
doesn't use it particularly well.
The key to this level I found, was cash flow, always make sure you have enough
ore miners, without cash flow you can't keep building faster than they can destroy.
Once your first nuke is ready, target the centre base of the Kremlin, save and
then Nuke it, if the health bar doesn't go to yellow, you haven't hit it
properly and try again, reload and make sure it is the centre base of the building.
Work hard of keeping your defence solid – there is only 10 minutes to
hold firm while your nuke re charges. When the nuke is ready nuke the Kremlin
in exactly the same place, if it isn't destroyed, re load and try nuking it
again. But with the Kremlin gone – mission accomplished, phew!

<p align="justify">我发现这可能是游戏中最困难的。您将不得不面对来自Yuri部队的无休止的攻击，而再次，防御和准备是关键。您所要做的就是摧毁克里姆林宫，为此，您将需要2次核打击。当任务开始建立时，您将需要2家炼油厂。此外，请确保稍后将地图的西南角留空，以方便核反应堆和核发射井。将2架基洛夫飞艇移到通往您基地的路径上方，稍向东北移动，这应该可以控制敌军步兵。一旦有了雷达，便开始建造特斯拉线圈-很多，建造约6面的墙，一旦有了战斗实验室，就建造Apocalypse坦克。也可以吸引更多的矿工，然后在基地的每个边缘建造3个高炮。基洛夫飞艇将降落在地图以南，向南，从地图以东，以西为西南方向，应该有3架高炮，但也要准备好其他高架航迹。建造一个核反应堆并出售您的特斯拉反应堆，并至关重要地建造一个筒仓，将其尽可能远地向西南放置，一直到地图的角落。您可能会失去除启示录坦克以外的所有单位，这些也可用于应对基洛夫长距离飞艇。只要不停地建造坦克，并保持特斯拉线圈非常坚固的墙，你就可以了。您想早点拿走的单位是控制您单位的通灵师，杀死他们比您自己的单位更有生产力。您只需要忍受这一任务的铁幕，说实话，计算机并不能很好地使用它。我发现达到这一水平的关键是现金流，请始终确保您有足够的矿工，没有现金流，您就无法保持建造速度快于破坏力。准备好第一个核弹之后，将目标对准克里姆林宫的中心基地，保存然后再核弹，如果保健栏没有变黄，则表示您没有正确击中它，然后重试，重新加载并确保它是建筑物的中心基地。努力保持防守稳固–核弹冲锋时，只有10分钟的时间保持坚定。当核弹准备就绪时，将克里姆林宫放在完全相同的位置，如果它没有被摧毁，请重新装弹并尝试再次核弹。但是，随着克里姆林宫的消失，任务完成了，！</p>

<p align="justify">尤里（Yuri）死后，苏联的至高无上的地位几乎被封印了-剩下的一切就是清理剩余的盟军并确保他们的失败。 感谢Zofia，他浏览了尤里（Yuri）的档案，发现了同盟国的终极武器，时空层（Chronosphere）。 它位于阿拉斯加的霍普角（Point Hope），其破坏将是苏联全球统治的最后一个组成部分。</p>

<h3  style="font-weight: bold;">Guide</h3>
<p align="justify">First things first, train lots of Tesla troops you will be under attack before
you can form much of a defence, build a refinery and have 10 or so Tesla troops
standing by for Allied troops Chrono-ing in. Also have a Tesla coil (you'll
need more power), or a Sentry gun ready to put in place. Also have flak
troopers ready to remove incoming Rocketeers.
Once you've help off these attacks, build the battle lab and shipyard, start
building subs, you'll only need 10 or so. Build a nuclear reactor and sell
Tesla reactors and get a nuke silo going. Also start cranking out Apocalypse
tanks. And on top of all this build a fair amount of flak defence.
Once you have enough subs send them towards the enemy bay (North West) Early on
the whole bay will be revealed, and this gives you plenty of nuking targets as
well as an air raid siren to make it more dramatic. Target the destroyers
first, then finish off the 2 shipyards. Build 2 dreadnaughts to help you along
with the attack on the landing bay, and of course, nuke it when you can. Use
the subs to reveal all the sea area. In terms of how many tanks you will need,
there really is no limit, I would have to say 20 is an absolute minimum

– that's 10 transports. To be honest when you run out or ore, that's
usually a good time to go.
If you can get a good sight of the shore above the cliff edge, use the
dreadnaughts to take out as much as possible, move your way up. If a prism
tower gets a shot of you it will be revealed and you can shoot at it.
When you are ready move all your transports across to the landing bay. Once
you've landed, move fast! Speed is the key to this mission from here onwards.
Eliminate all of the allied base in this area then head north. Crucially
destroy the war factory and construction yard there. Head north, enemy units
will Chrono in there masses, in the form of IFV's prism tanks and tanks. Head
north pushing your way though basses and defences until you reach the most
northern point, do remember though the more you destroy the faster the tanks
get promoted which will help later on
When you have moved north enough, Kirov airships will appear, these can be used
if you want, but I've always been too frustrated by their slowness. That said
it can be useful to send them South West where there are some prism towers on
top of a cliff. Send the tanks west and then south to the west of the cliff.
You will probably lose your airships to the crazy numbers of IFV's. Once the
area is clear, move south west.
Here you will encounter heavy base defences that you will need to remove with
your tanks, push your way through. Once you are through this base, you are
nearly there, fight through more defences and walls to the south west, and
inside you will find the Chronosphere – take it out and the mission and
indeed the whole of Red Alert 2 is complete – Congratulations.</p>


<p align="justify">首先，要训练很多特斯拉部队，使他们处于防御状态，建立炼油厂，并有10左右特斯拉部队待盟军编排，然后训练他们。则需要更多动力），或者准备放置哨兵枪。也要准备高射炮部队以移走即将来临的火箭兵。一旦解决了这些攻击，建立了战斗实验室和造船厂，开始建造潜艇，您只需要10个左右即可。建造一个核反应堆，出售特斯拉反应堆，并获得核武器发射井。同时开始启动启示录坦克。最重要的是，建立了相当数量的防空防御能力。一旦您有足够的潜艇将它们发送到敌人的海湾（西北），整个海湾的尽头就会显现出来，这给您提供了很多打击目标以及空袭警报器，使它更具戏剧性。首先瞄准驱逐舰，然后离开两个造船厂。建造2个无畏舰可以帮助您应对登陆湾的袭击，当然，如果可以的话，请向其进攻。使用潜艇揭示所有海域。关于您需要多少个坦克，实际上没有限制，我必须说20个绝对最小值–即10辆运输车。老实说，当您用完矿石时，通常是个好时机。如果您可以清楚看到悬崖边缘上方的海岸，请尽量使用无畏的东西将其爬出，然后向上移动。如果棱镜塔射中了您，它将被显示出来，您可以射中它。准备就绪后，将所有运输工具移到着陆湾。降落后，请快速行动！从现在开始，速度是执行此任务的关键。消除该地区的所有盟军基地，然后向北行驶。严重破坏那里的战争工厂和建造场。向北行驶，敌军单位将以IFV的棱形坦克和坦克的形式在这里计时。往北走，通过低音和防御装置直到到达最北端，请记住，虽然破坏越多，坦克的提升速度就越快，这将在以后有所帮助。当您向北移动足够多时，基洛夫飞艇将出现，这些可以如果需要的话，可以使用它，但是我一直对它们的缓慢性感到沮丧。也就是说，将它们发送到西南方可能很有用，因为在悬崖顶上有一些棱镜塔。将坦克向西发送，然后向南发送到悬崖的西部。您可能会因为疯狂的IFV而失去飞艇。清除区域后，向西南移动。在这里，您将遇到沉重的基础防御设施，您需要将其随坦克一起拆除，并继续前进。穿过这个基地后，您就快到了，穿越西南的更多防御工事和城墙，在内部，您会发现Chronosphere-赶快行动，任务和红色警戒2的整个任务都完成了-恭喜。</p>
